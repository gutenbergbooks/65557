<h3><span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>Preface</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'><span class='dropcap'>H</span><span class='sc'>ighways</span> of Canadian Literature</span> provides teachers
and students in educational institutions and readers
in general with a complete history of the Canadian literature
extant in the English language. In very recent years
Canadian universities and colleges have added to their
curricula systematic study of the verse and prose of the
chief writers born in or resident in the Dominion. Also,
teachers in Canadian academies and high schools, as occasion
affords opportunity, inform their pupils about the
lives and work of Canadian authors. Further: as expressive
of the new and increasing interest in Canadian
Literature, Literary Clubs, Reading Clubs, and Reading
Circles have been formed, and constantly are being formed,
to promote ‘community’ study of the writings of Canadian
men and women of letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto, however, those who wished to be informed
on the literary history of Canada and the status of Canadian
Literature, had to depend on Anthologies, summary
annalistic Sketches, and biographical Compendia. The
earlier anthologies comprise verse either chronologically or
topically arranged, but some of them contain, in an Appendix,
biographical notes on the authors represented in
the volumes. The later anthologies, as, for instance,
Garvin’s <span class='it'>Canadian Poets</span>, contain, besides the ‘selections,’
biographical and critical introductions. These anthologies,
though comprehensive, informing and delightful ‘source-books,’
do not, by themselves, disclose the <span class='it'>development</span> of
Canadian Literature. The annalistic sketches or compendia,
on the other hand, are too sketchy, too annalistic.
They do not tell the story of the development of Canadian
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
Literature with any attempt at perspective or at disclosing
its social and spiritual origins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, therefore, pressing need for a comprehensive
Synoptic History of Canadian Literature. Such a work
would furnish the teacher, the student, and the general
reader with a ‘method’ of reading Canadian Literature
with philosophical insight or with historical and critical
perspective. It would distinguish certain ‘epochs’ and
‘movements’ in the literary history of Canada, and make
clear how Canadian poets and prose writers are related
to one another and have influenced one another, and how,
gradually, they expressed in literature the slowly emerging
consciousness of a national spirit and a national destiny
in the Dominion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is what <span class='it'>Highways of Canadian Literature</span> attempts
to do. In scope it is a complete or comprehensive
survey of literary ‘epochs’ and ‘movements’ in Canada,
beginning with the Puritan Migration from the American
Colonies in 1760 and closing at the end of the first quarter
of the 20th century. In method it is both historical and
critical. It orientates the ‘backgrounds’ of Canadian
Literature, traces the social and spiritual origins of that
literature, remarks special ‘influences,’ demarcates several
‘epochs’ and ‘movements,’ discusses the importance of outstanding
Canadian authors, and supplies critical estimates
of Canadian prose and poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is designed for the use of teachers and students in
universities, colleges, academies, seminaries, and high
schools, and of general readers. Together with suitable
anthologies or selections it will furnish teachers and
students with adequate equipment for a systematic study
of Canadian Literature, and general readers and members
of literary clubs equally adequate equipment for ‘home’ or
‘club’ study of the development of Canadian Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chapters on Post-Confederation Fiction (Chapters
XVI and XVII—Novelists and Short Story Writers of the
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
First Renaissance and Chapter XXI—Fiction Writers of the
Second Renaissance) were written, expressly at my solicitation,
by Mr. Donald G. French, whose wide and intimate
knowledge of the forms, technics, and history of Canadian
fiction is recognized throughout Canada. For many years
he has been assiduous, as an essayist and lecturer, in reviewing
and promoting the study of Canadian imaginative
prose fiction, and his experience of many years as reviewer,
and later as literary editor for a book publishing house, has
given him special opportunities to study the history and
observe the evolution of Canadian imaginative prose.
Moreover, since Mr. French is also well versed in the
forms, history, and technics of Canadian poetry, and since
he has a temperamental patience, which engenders in him
the ‘wise passiveness’ essential to the just critic, I engaged
for the book as a whole his taste and judgment, in regard
to treatment and style, and his knowledge of facts of Canadian
literary history. The text of the book is therefore
enhanced in treatment and style, as well as in critical justice,
by Mr. French’s contribution, and by his critical
revision of the whole work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish, here, specially to remark my ideal and aim in
writing <span class='it'>Highways of Canadian Literature</span>. It is, I believe,
the duty of the literary historian and critic to respect his
subject and to present it under its most significant and
engaging aspects in order that he may win others to equal
respect for his subject. Canadian Literature is important
at least to Canadians; and, whatever be its comparative
aesthetic and artistic dignity, it is an integral part or
branch of English Literature. This book will justify itself
if it compels Canadians to recognize the importance of
their own literature, and wins other peoples to a decent
respect for a literature which, while still in its adolescence,
shows evidences of attaining to independent and vigorous
adult estate—in the event of which Canadian literary creation,
taste, and judgment will be based, not on the work of
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
British or of American masters of poetry and imaginative
prose, but on that of Canadian masters. Meanwhile, this
book aims to disclose to Canadians the social and spiritual
importance of their own literature and to determine its
place or distinction in English Literature—in short, to promote
in Canada and abroad what may aptly be called ‘the
higher study’ of Canadian Literature.</p>

<h3><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>Preliminary Survey</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>o</span> write properly a Synoptic History of Canadian
Literature, the historian must first evaluate extant
Canadian verse and prose from the point of view of the
Whole. Secondly, he must treat Canadian Literature as
a Whole in respect to its Genetic bases and relations. In
presenting this synoptic history, Canadian Literature is
considered not as a special, isolated, and chance product,
but as the definitive outcome of racial, naturalistic, social,
economic, and political conditions within the vast Dominion
itself, and of other conditions brought into existence by
racial affinities and social, political, economic, and spiritual
relations with the people of the United States and the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general treatment proceeds on an <span class='it'>a priori</span> presumption
and a critical principle. The <span class='it'>a priori</span> presumption is
that in Canada where verse and prose which possess all degrees
of worth have for more than a century and a half been
produced in the English language and which had English
poetry and prose for models, there must be a respectable
residue of authentic literature written by native-born and
resident <span class='it'>émigré</span> Canadian authors. In a phrase, the <span class='it'>fact</span>
of a Canadian Literature is presumed. The critical principle
employed in the treatment is this: that however
insignificant, from the point of view of world literature,
Canadian Literature may be, it is <span class='it'>important to Canadians
themselves</span>. For however unimportant Canadian historical
romances, Canadian humor, Canadian nature-poetry, Canadian
poetic drama, Canadian realistic fiction, Canadian
monodies may be when compared with the same <span class='it'>genres</span> in
English Literature, they are the representatives of Canadian
culture and of the Canadian creative spirit; if they were not
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
extant there would be no Canadian Literature at all; and
thus the Canadian people would be spiritually poorer and
less significant not only to themselves but also to the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some fair show of the fact of an authentic Canadian
Literature may be evident from the following considerations.
Let it be granted, as axiomatic, that verse and
prose rise to the dignity of literature when they express
and promote existence ideally—by delighting the aesthetic
senses, by consoling the heart, by inspiring the moral
imagination, by exalting or transporting the spirit. Judged
by this four-fold test, the best Canadian poetry and
imaginative prose will compare favorably with the admittedly
authentic poetry and prose of many of the significant
British and United States authors in the mid-Victorian era.
In Canadian verse in English are genuine ‘gems’ of poetry,
which, for vision, imagery, passion, lyrical eloquence, verbal
music, and mastery of form and technique, are hardly,
if at all, surpassed by the poetry of Coleridge, Shelley,
Keats, Wordsworth, Tennyson, Swinburne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this is doubted, in part or in whole, then apply this
concrete pragmatic test:—For exquisite tenderness and
simple pathos: with Tennyson’s <span class='it'>Break, Break, Break</span>, compare
Charles G. D. Roberts’ sweetly sad lyric, <span class='it'>Grey Rocks
and Greyer Sea</span>. For delicacy or for poignancy in expressing
the passion and meaning of love: with Swinburne’s
<span class='it'>These Many Years</span>, compare Roberts’ <span class='it'>O Red Rose of Life</span>,
or with Browning’s <span class='it'>Evelyn Hope</span>, compare Roberts’
<span class='it'>A Nocturne of Consecration</span>. For power to visualize the
ghostly and ghastly: with Coleridge’s <span class='it'>The Ancient Mariner</span>
compare the vivid, uncanny pictures of a spectral ship and
crew in Bliss Carman’s <span class='it'>Nancy’s Pride</span>. For beauty of
descriptive imagery, verbal music, and expressive correspondence
of emotion with the mood of the season in nature-poetry:
with Keats’ <span class='it'>Ode to Autumn</span>, compare Archibald
Lampman’s lovely lyric of earth, <span class='it'>September</span>. For dignity
of thought and mastery of technic: with the finest sonnets
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
of Wordsworth, compare Roberts’ <span class='it'>The Sower</span>, or those
noble sonnets by Lampman, beginning, ‘Not to be conquered
by these headlong days,’ ‘Come with thine unveiled
worlds, O truth of Night,’ and ‘There is a beauty at the
goal of life.’ For dramatic power in sounding the depths
of elemental passion and emotion: with Tennyson’s <span class='it'>Rizpah</span>,
compare Campbell’s profound utterance of the heart of
woman in <span class='it'>The Mother</span>, or with the more subtle of Browning’s
dramatic monologues compare Campbell’s psychological
revealments in <span class='it'>Unabsolved</span>, and in <span class='it'>The Confession
of Tama the Wise</span>. For the dainty, piquant expression of
all those experiences which delight and console us in our
humaner moments of reflection and reverie, let these pure
lyrics be a daily rosary:—F. G. Scott’s <span class='it'>The Cripple</span>, <span class='it'>Van
Risen</span>, and <span class='it'>A Reverie</span>; Campbell’s <span class='it'>The Hills and the Sea</span>,
<span class='it'>Vapor and Blue</span>, and <span class='it'>Lake Huron</span>; Lampman’s <span class='it'>We, too,
Shall Sleep</span>, <span class='it'>The Weaver</span> and <span class='it'>The Passing of Autumn</span>;
Carman’s <span class='it'>Spring Song</span>, commencing ‘Make me over,
mother April,’ <span class='it'>The Ships of St. John</span>, and <span class='it'>The Grave Tree</span>;
Roberts’ <span class='it'>The Lone Wharf</span>, <span class='it'>Lake Aylesford</span>, <span class='it'>Afoot</span>, <span class='it'>Kinship</span>,
and <span class='it'>Recessional</span>; Duncan Campbell Scott’s <span class='it'>The End
of the Day</span>, and <span class='it'>A Lover to His Lass</span>; and Pauline Johnson’s
<span class='it'>In the Shadows</span>. Consider, too, that the satiric humor
and comic characterization of Thomas Chandler Haliburton
are not only in some respects unsurpassed by the art of
Cervantes, Dickens, Daudet, and Mark Twain, and that
Haliburton’s comic epigrams and moral maxims and certain
of his comic characters have become part of the warp
and woof of English literature. It is also indubitable that
the two volumes of short stories of Duncan Campbell Scott—<span class='it'>In
the Village of Viger</span> and <span class='it'>The Witching of Elspie</span>—are
not excelled either in originality of conception or in
technical artistry, and certainly not in spiritual beauty and
pathos, by the short stories of Maupassant in France, of
Stevenson or Hewlett in England, of Cable or Mary Wilkins
Freeman in the United States.
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In two other fields, the elegiac monody and poetic
drama, Canadian poets have produced distinctive and impressive
literature. It is admitted by British and United
States critics that the threnodies of Campbell, Carman,
Roberts, Duncan Campbell Scott, Marshall, and De Mille
are distinctly noble in conception and imagery and artistically
finished, and would be worthy of the genius even
of Milton, Shelley, Keats, Arnold, and Emerson, and deserve
to be placed in the company of the other fine
threnodies written in the English language. It is also admitted
by British and United States critics that the poetic
dramas of Mair, Campbell, and Norwood, whether embodying
Biblical, Arthurian, or Canadian legends and romantic
characters, show authentic genius of dramatic conception
and a notable distinction in technical structure and artistry
while, to their credit, avoiding what Edmund Gosse has
called the ‘violences and verbosities’ of the Elizabethan
Tradition and of the Restoration and later poetic drama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In England, at least as early as the ‘nineties’ of the last
century, the fact of a respectable Canadian literature received
a sort of spasmodic recognition. A genuine interest
in it, or at least in Canadian poetry, was evoked in the
United Kingdom by the visit of the late Pauline Johnson
to London and her recitals there in 1894. As a matter of
fact, Pauline Johnson’s first volume of verse <span class='it'>The White
Wampum</span> was published originally in London in 1895.
Again: with the permanent residence of Sir Gilbert Parker,
and other Canadian men and women of letters, as, for
instance, Miss Jean McIlwraith and Miss Lily Dougall, in
England, the interest in Canadian Literature, on the part
of the British people and critics, was very considerably
intensified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the World War caused, first, an intenser sense
of the unity of the Motherland and Canada, and, secondly,
a plethora of verse and prose, especially verse, by Canadians
in the field in France and in Flanders, and by
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
Canadians at home, there arose in England a definite and
systematic movement to promote in the United Kingdom
the recognition and study of the literary history and literature
of Canada, or at least Canadian literature written in
the nineteenth century and first quarter of the twentieth
century. Sir Herbert Warren, President of Magdalen
College, Oxford, who for some time during the late war
was Professor of Poetry at Oxford, engaged in a serious
and sympathetic study of the literature of Canada, and
lectured on Canadian literature at the Colonial Institute,
London, and elsewhere. Moreover, Sir Herbert Warren,
then also President of the Poetry Society of London, had a
by-law passed which stipulated that living Canadian authors
should be recognized as non-resident members of the Poetry
Society of London; and Canadian authors were invited to
send copies of their published verse and prose to the
Librarian of the Poetry Society, for cataloguing and exhibition
in the reading room of the Society. Besides Sir
Herbert Warren, two other British lecturers of established
reputation—Miss Louise Bagley and Miss Julie Huntsman—devoted
themselves to systematic lecturing on Canadian
literature, verse and prose, in certain notable educational
institutions in London and in provincial centres in England.
Moreover, since the late war the works of Canadian
authors have been in increasing numbers either published
in England simultaneously with their publication in other
countries, or have been first published in England and
later republished in Canada, and in the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these facts, therefore, we have a kind of empirical
proof or pragmatic test that in the United Kingdom there
has existed for a considerable time a genuinely respectful
recognition of the fact of a Canadian literature in the
English language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the purposes of a Synoptic History of Canadian
Literature in the English language a significant year is that
of 1760. For that year marks both the Fall of Montreal
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
(following the Fall of Quebec in 1759) and the Puritan
Migration from New England to Maugerville, on the St.
John River, and to the valleys of western Nova Scotia, in
‘Nova Scotia,’ which at the time embraced the mainland
of what is now Nova Scotia, as well as New Brunswick, and
part of Maine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The significance of this date for a History of Canadian
Literature in English will be realized by reflecting that
from 1760 onwards until Confederation in 1867,—that is,
a period of one hundred years—the two pioneer Provinces
of the later Dominion, Quebec and the original Nova Scotia,
and, in due time, Ontario, came under the influence of a
specific British and a specific New England and Loyalist
civilization and culture which essentially determined the
political, social, and spiritual ideas and ideals of the
English-speaking people in Canada. These specifically
pioneer and pre-Confederation ideas and ideals form the
social and spiritual bases of Canadian Literature in English,
from 1760 to 1867.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More particularly, it is important to note that the
struggle of the British North American Provinces to realize
the ideals of Responsible Government, which the Puritan
settlers brought with them and which were effected in 1848
in three of the Provinces later confederated, caused the
first awakening of the literary spirit, and the actual creation
of the first nativistic literature, in Canada. This struggle
for Responsible Government and of other higher spiritual
interests and ideals before 1848 and afterwards, including
the later struggle for political union (Confederation) of
the Provinces, not only incited Canadian poets and prose
writers to literary expression during the period, but also
largely determined the form, substance, and mood or
temper of that literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A distinction must be drawn between (1) the literature
written in or about Canada by British authors, visiting or
sojourning in the Canadas and the Maritime Provinces, as,
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
for instance, Tom Moore’s <span class='it'>Canadian Boat Song</span> (1804)
and much other verse and prose down to Louis Hémon’s
realistic romance of French-Canada, <span class='it'>Maria Chapdelaine</span>
(1922), all of which will be noted but will be denominated
the ‘Incidental’ Literature; and (2) the literature which was
written by permanently resident <span class='it'>émigrés</span> and by native-born
citizens in the <span class='it'>separate</span> (unconfederate) Provinces,
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the Canadas, up to the
year of Confederation, which will be designated the
‘Nativistic’ Literature; and (3) the literature, after Confederation,
written by native-born Canadians, which will
be called the ‘Native and National’ Literature of Canada.
These literary distinctions themselves are demanded by an
important demarcation in the social groups which, from the
Fall of Montreal in 1760 and the Puritan Migration from
New England in the same year up to the last Loyalist
Migration, in 1786, from New England and the other
revolutionary States, formed the social and cultural units
of the Anglo-Saxon civilization in what, after the acknowledgment
of American Independence and up to the
Confederation of the Canadian Provinces, was known
definitively as British North America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following 1760 and the British Occupation of Montreal
and Quebec City, the civilization and culture of the social
groups in these centres and, later, in the Loyalist centres
in Ontario, were on another and lower level than the culture
and civilization in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
Moreover, the literature written by the groups of English-speaking
people, sojourning or permanently resident in the
Canadas, neither sprang from the social and spiritual
necessities which created the literature of the Maritime
Provinces in their Puritan and Loyalist period, nor possessed
the aesthetic and spiritual qualities of the literature
produced in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in the
Puritan and Loyalist period of their history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Anglo-Saxon civilization and culture in Montreal
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
and Quebec, after the British Occupation (1760), was
highly military and practical; that is to say, materialistic.
For the English-speaking people in Quebec were concerned
wholly with the civil and military administration of Quebec
City and Province, and the English-speaking people in
Montreal were concerned chiefly with the development of
trade, particularly the fur trade, under men who were adventurers
much more than they were colonizers and
civilizers. Naturally, therefore, Canadian Literature in
English in the Province of Quebec chiefly consisted of
chronicles, annals, and narratives (historical, or of adventure);
and, secondly, whenever it happened to be pure
literature, comprised verse and prose written by cultured
visitors from the Motherland; and thus in all cases this
‘Incidental’ Pioneer Canadian Literature in English in the
Province of Quebec was British in inspiration, form, and
aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, the Puritan and Loyalist migrations
to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, particularly Nova
Scotia, from 1760 to 1783 and later, comprised groups of
English-speaking people who were intellectually cultured
and spiritually-minded. The literature, verse and prose,
which they produced was the urgent expression of political,
social, and spiritual needs; and, being for the most part
satiric, was modelled on the pre-revolutionary literature of
their relatives in New England and the other Atlantic
States, which, in its time, had been modelled on the satiric
neo-classical verse and the polemic and satiric prose of the
eighteenth century in England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that the genius of the literature written in the
Province of Quebec from the British Occupation of Montreal
to the triumph of Responsible Government in 1848,
and somewhat later, was pragmatic rather than literary;
whereas the genius of the literature produced in the same
period in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, particularly in
Nova Scotia, was definitively literary in spirit and form.
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The civilization and culture of the Loyalist centres in
Ontario, brought in by the Loyalist Migrations, 1783-1786,
and later by the settlements of British-born <span class='it'>émigrés</span>, chiefly
discharged soldiers, officials, and mechanics, after the close
of the Napoleonic wars, 1815, were essentially practical and
materialistic. On the whole the literature produced in
Ontario, particularly up to the triumph of Responsible
Government was, as in Quebec Province, a literature of
annals and chronicles and narratives. However, during
this period and onwards to Confederation, particularly after
the war of 1812 and during the rebellion of 1837, there
appeared in the Canadas some genuinely aesthetic verse and
prose, written by British-born sojourners or permanent
<span class='it'>émigrés</span> and by native authors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were, in the third quarter of the eighteenth century,
several other migrations of small groups of English-speaking
people to Nova Scotia and the Canadas, notably a
group of Scots. The English Migration in 1749, under
Cornwallis, to Halifax was of no significance in the literary
history of Canada; nor were the Swiss and German Migrations
to Nova Scotia of literary significance. On the other
hand, the Scots Migration to Pictou, Nova Scotia, 1773,
had a most decided <span class='it'>intellectual</span> influence not only on Nova
Scotia, but also on the whole of what is now known as
Canada. It had, however, no influence on specific <span class='it'>literary</span>
culture and literary creation, save Journalism, in Canada
as a whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, it must be observed that in literary culture
and the production of literature in the English language
in Canada from 1760 to Confederation, taking these merely
as convenient dates, Nova Scotia (including New Brunswick)
during the Puritan and Loyalist period and up to
the triumph of Responsible Government, and even still
later, not only produced the most significant and authentic
literature, but also Nova Scotia is to be regarded as the
first home of an originally ‘Nativistic’ Literature produced
in Canada.
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to Confederation there could not be, as there was
not, any innate and natural sentiment of Canadian nationality
in the hearts of the people. The motive of Confederation
was not based on sentiment but on practical political
vision and expediency. The ideal of Confederation, before
it was achieved, was wholly an intellectual concept.
If, therefore, the Canadian Confederacy were to endure,
it was imperative that the intellectual ideal, for the factual
realization of it, should become powerful over the hearts
and imagination of the Canadian people after the fact of
Confederation in 1867—that there should develop, or be
developed, in the souls of the Canadian people a definitive
sentiment of nationality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This meant that following the consummation of Confederation
the people of Canada should find themselves
pledged to and engaged in a distinctly new and novel
political and social program. This program was chiefly one
of political and social consolidation and of industrial and
commercial expansion. It was most astutely and effectively,
though slowly, carried out. With the ever-increasing
political and social unification of the people and the intellectual
and commercial expansion of the country, a genuine
sentiment of Canadian nationality gradually developed, until
by the time of the Great World War, 1914-1918, and
largely in consequence of Canada’s part in that war, the
sentiment of Canadian nationality suddenly acquired a
pervasive intensity and evolved into a definite and profound
sense of distinct nationhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, with this development in political and social consolidation,
and territorial, industrial, and commercial expansion,
and the evolution of a sentiment of nationality
and, later, nationhood, it was inevitable that there should
be not only a change in the literary ideals, inspiration, and
aims of Canadian men and women of letters, but also that,
with this change in aesthetic and artistic conscience, the
literature produced in Canada, after Confederation, should
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
be different in substance, form, and technical artistry or
craftsmanship from the literature produced prior to Confederation.
It was also inevitable that immediately upon
Confederation, when, naturally, political and social consolidation
and the sentiment of nationality were virtually
at zero point or at least were inchoate, the literary ideals
of Canadian men and women of letters should be, in substance
and form, for a decade or so, traditional and
derivative, not indigenous and originally Canadian. It
was indeed so: for at least a decade there was hardly any
independent or original native Canadian literature, or in
it even a simmering of the sentiment of Canadian nationality,
though there was a considerable quantity of ‘journalistic’
and imaginative poetry and prose which possessed
distinctive and even engaging aesthetic and artistic qualities,
written both by permanently resident <span class='it'>émigrés</span> and by native-born
Canadians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1868, for instance, Charles Mair, a native-born
Canadian, published his <span class='it'>Dreamland and Other Poems</span>;
and in 1870 John Reade, an Irishman long resident in
Canada, published a volume of verse, <span class='it'>The Prophecy of
Merlin and Other Poems</span>: but while Mair’s poems contained
Canadian sentiment and color they were the
sentiment and color of <span class='it'>objective</span> Nature in Canada; and
while John Reade’s volume was written in Canada and
though the poet really felt and was in sympathy with all
the political, social, and spiritual aspirations of Canada,
Reade’s poems themselves were based chiefly upon Arthurian
legend and were written in a derivative English
romantic manner of form, music, and color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mair and Reade and others were having an influence,
however, in holding up the ideal of authentic literary creation
in Canada while during that decade and the following
decade a group of young native-born Canadians were
growing into manhood, and were having engendered in
their hearts and imagination a distinct innate sentiment of
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
Canadian nationality and were to become the first native-born
group of <span class='it'>systematic</span> poets and prose writers in Canada.
Their work, in poetry and prose, may fairly be signalized
as the First Renaissance in Canadian Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This group, for the purposes of literary history, we have
denominated the Systematic School of Canadian poets and
prose writers. For with the publication of Chas. G. D.
Roberts’ <span class='it'>Orion and Other Poems</span> in 1880, a native-born
leader for native-born men and women of letters appeared
in Canada; and with the publication of Roberts’ <span class='it'>In Divers
Tones</span> in 1887 in Canada (in U. S. 1886), there appeared
at length the first ‘Voice’ of the Spirit of Canada, expressed
in poetic literature, artistic in structure and noble in inspiration.
The authentic beginning of strictly so-called Canadian
Literature in English must, therefore, be dated from
1887. Roberts and his colleagues, Lampman, Carman,
Campbell, D. C. Scott, F. G. Scott, Pauline Johnson, Gilbert
Parker and Marshall Saunders are designated the
Systematic School of Canadian poets and prose writers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The First Renaissance in Canadian Native and National
Literature may be said to close either with the publication
of Pauline Johnson’s last volume of poems, <span class='it'>Canadian Born</span>,
in 1903, or with the publication of Robert Service’s first
volume of verse, <span class='it'>Songs of a Sourdough</span> (1907). By this
is not meant that after twenty years of leadership and influence
the first Systematic Group had not continued to
hold up the ideal to the younger or later Canadian poets
and prose writers or that there were no Canadian poets
and prose writers who were continuing the older ideal and
tradition. As a matter of fact, the creative and artistic
ideals of the first group of systematic poets and prose
writers had become engendered in the aesthetic and artistic
conscience of the younger or later men and women of letters
in Canada; and the poetry and prose produced by the
younger or later Canadian men and women of letters were
notably refined in sentiment, beautiful in structure and
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
imagery, and noble in spiritual substance and appeal. They
continued, and still continue, as do also Roberts, Carman,
Duncan Campbell Scott and the other living members of
the original Systematic Group, the tradition of aesthetic
and artistic verse and prose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in 1907 another singing voice was heard; and there
developed a group of poetasters and picaresque fictionists
whose leader was Robert Service. Their special literary
<span class='it'>métier</span> was verse, though Service and his literary <span class='it'>confrères</span>
also essayed fiction. This group we call the Vaudeville
School of Canadian Poetry. Its vogue lasted for an insignificant
period of five years, or from 1908 up to the
beginning of the Great World War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1913 appeared a new group of younger Canadian
poets and prose writers, who may be regarded as having
begun the Second Renaissance in Canadian literature. They
inaugurated, as it were, a Restoration Period in Canadian
literature, inasmuch as, with some changes in ideals of
form and craftsmanship, they essentially ‘restored’ the
literary principles and aims of the First Renaissance Group.
All these distinctions in nomenclature and dates are, of
course, only used for expository or pedagogical purposes.
Accordingly, it is convenient to mark the beginning of the
Second Renaissance, or the Restoration Period, in Canadian
Literature with the publication of Marjorie Pickthall’s
first volume of verse, <span class='it'>Drift of Pinions</span>, in 1913.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This period in Canadian Literature in English is still
in process. It is showing definitive originality in several
ways, including original developments in modernity of
theme and moral substance, in formal novelty, and in fresh
expression of neglected or hitherto unessayed literary
<span class='it'>genres</span>, such as, for instance, poetic and stage drama, and
essays strictly in <span class='it'>belles-lettres</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Contemporary with the poets of this period is a group
of fictionists, who have produced and are producing novels,
romances, and tales which are Canadian in theme, in social
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
background, and in color. This group may be distinguished
as the Realistic School of Canadian Fiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These distinctions thus determine the scope of the
present work as a Synoptic History of Canadian Literature.
The literature considered or treated comprises—(I)
Pre-Confederation Literature (1760-1887); and (II)
Post-Confederation Literature (1887——?). The Pre-Confederation
Literature, which, for purposes of exposition
or treatment, is viewed as running over into two
decades beyond 1867, will be considered under three rubrics—(1)
Incidental Pioneer Literature; (2) Emigré Literature
and (3) Nativistic Literature. Post-Confederation
Literature will be treated under a single rubric—Native
and National Literature of Canada; and this indigenous
Canadian literature will, for expository and pedagogical
purposes, be considered under five Schools (or Periods)—(1)
the Systematic School and Period (First Renaissance);
(2) the Vaudeville School and Period (Decadent Interim);
(3) the Restoration School and Period (Second Renaissance);
(4) the Realistic School and Period of Fiction;
and (5) the Rise of Realistic Native or National Drama.
But these formal divisions cannot be kept mathematically
rigid and there will necessarily be overlappings and special
consideration of both imaginative and aesthetic Canadian
literature, such as poetic drama, <span class='it'>belles-lettres</span>, hymnody and
literary criticism, journalism, and the literature of travel,
exploration, history, and biography.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The method of treatment and criticism employed in the
present work is also Synoptic or Philosophical. The synoptic
method adopts the point of view of Canadian literary
history and literature as a spiritual Whole. It has distinct
and desirable advantages over the other critical and
pedagogical methods. For the synoptic method assists the
imagination to view Canadian authors and their literature
in an inclusive historical perspective, and thus to discover
in Canadian Literature the evolution of a people’s social
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
and spiritual ideals, their national and world conceptions,
and how and what each individual poet or prose writer,
or each group or school of poets and prose writers, has
contributed to the vision of the people’s social and spiritual
ideals and to the evolution of them in the people’s social
conscience. Further: the synoptic method disengages and
discriminates the essential excellences of the poetry and
prose of particular individuals and groups, and enables
the critic or historian rightly to estimate the social and
spiritual significance and value of Canadian authors ideas
on Nature, Society, human Existence, and Endeavor.</p>

SCOTIA IN THE CREATIVE LITERATURE OF CANADA—LITERARY
SPECIES IN ONTARIO AND QUEBEC.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>C</span><span class='sc'>reative</span> literature in the Provinces which now
form the Dominion of Canada, really or most significantly
began in Nova Scotia. The social bases of this
Nova Scotian pioneer literature, its literary forms, and
even its inspiration were of New England origin. It is
highly important clearly to understand all this. In 1760,
or two years after the proclamation of Governor Lawrence
and the establishment of a Legislative Assembly in Nova
Scotia, seven thousand Puritans emigrated from Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, and Connecticut to Maugerville on
the St. John River, and to the valleys of western Nova
Scotia. The expulsion of the Acadians had left the fertile
farms of western Nova Scotia deserted. These lands were
naturally attractive to the people of New England, inasmuch
as the soil was not only fertile, but the country itself
was, at the time, part of British North America, as was
New England itself. As soon as the Acadians had been
expelled, the Governor of Nova Scotia set up military
control and government. Moreover, the Anglican Church
was the dominant creed. In New England civil and religious
liberty were regarded as absolutely necessary to the
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
life of the people. When, then, in 1758, Governor Lawrence
brought about the formation of a Legislative Assembly
and proclaimed civil and religious liberty for Nova
Scotia, the New England Puritans felt free to come to Nova
Scotia, which promised them an acceptable new home, both
for the obtaining of material possessions and the free expression
of their spiritual ideals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1763 other groups of New Englanders, with their
characteristic ideals, came to Nova Scotia. In 1783, 1785
and 1786, following the War of American Independence,
thirty thousand United Empire Loyalists emigrated from
the Atlantic States and settled in Nova Scotia; ten thousand
settled in Lower Canada (Quebec); and twenty thousand
settled in the district which later became the Province
of Ontario. So that, in a period of twenty-five years,
about one hundred thousand <span class='it'>émigrés</span> from the United States
coast had become permanent residents of the Maritime
Provinces and the Canadas. That is to say, the bases of
Canadian civilization and culture, following the Fall of
Montreal and beginning with the first Puritan Migration,
were definitively the social, political, intellectual, and literary
ideals of New England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1749 there was a migration of English from the
Motherland to Halifax. They founded the City of Halifax.
These English <span class='it'>émigrés</span>, however, found conditions of life
at Halifax so forbidding by way of hardships and so
socially unsettling that many of them removed to Boston
and to New York. Subsequently their descendants came
from New England and New York to Halifax. It was
they, not their fathers, who really founded the City of
Halifax and did most for the development of commerce
and culture in that community. Later, when Halifax became
a British Military and Naval Station, it took on an
English ‘air.’ But essentially its culture and commerce
were of New England Puritan origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1773 occurred the Scots migration to Pictou, on the
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
North shore of Nova Scotia. These colonists were but a
little band of two hundred; yet they brought with them
two ideals which eventually pervaded the civilization and
culture of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Viewed, then, synoptically, the civilization and culture
of the Dominion of Canada, as we conceive and appreciate
the significance of Canada to-day, had their origins in
Puritanism and Calvinism—in the ideals brought into Nova
Scotia and the Canadas by the New England and the Scots
Migrations in the 18th century. Specifically, the New
England colonists, especially the Loyalists, brought, with
them the literary ideals which were to become the creative
principles of the first native-born poets and prose writers
of Nova Scotia and the Canadas. Specifically, the Scots
colonists brought into Nova Scotia two ideals of spiritual
import; namely, the ideal of the supreme worth of the
individual human spirit and its salvation, and the ideal of
sound intellectual education as the basis of the life of the
spirit both for this world and the world to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To appreciate critically the results of the Loyalist ideals
on the creative literary spirit in Nova Scotia, we must hark
back to pre-Revolutionary times in New England and the
other Atlantic Colonies and to the social conditions and
spiritual problems of the people of Nova Scotia following
the Loyalist Migrations. In pre-revolutionary days in the
New England and the other Atlantic Colonies, the weapon
used both by those who were for separation from England
and those who were loyal to the British Crown was a literary
weapon—prose and poetry. Naturally pre-revolutionary
literature in the American Colonies was modelled on
the mood and form of the satiric verse and pamphlets of
the 18th century poets and prosemen of England. The
American colonies became alive especially with poetic
satirists. When, therefore, the Loyalists settled in Nova
Scotia and the Canadas, and when, in due course, they
themselves had to face the discussion and solution of new
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
social and political problems, inevitably they adopted the
18th century forms of literary expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what of the Puritan settlers in Nova Scotia? They
were in the land for at least a decade before the coming
of the Loyalists. They had social and religious problems
for discussion and solution. Did not these problems of
the Puritan <span class='it'>émigrés</span> issue in a literature? They did. But
the Puritan literature in Nova Scotia was not in mood,
aim, form, or result at all significant, or as genuinely
creative as the Loyalist literature, and may be shortly
noticed and dismissed. The Puritans were Congregationalists,
and brought with them the old New England
ideals of the ‘Town Meeting’—Responsible Civic Government
and Religious Liberty. They were political and
religious Democrats. But Church interests were paramount.
Congregationalism, though essentially a democratic
form of Church government, developed all the
formalism, of an aristocratically conducted religion. The
inevitable happened. There were ‘fundamentalists’ and
‘modernists’ in those days as in ours. Under Whitefield
a schism occurred in Congregationalism. The leader of
the schism in Nova Scotia was Rev. Henry Alline (1748-84).
Under Whitefield in the American Colonies and
Henry Alline, ‘the Whitefield of Province’ of Nova Scotia,
the ‘New Lights’ (as they were called) triumphed over
the Orthodox or Formalistic Congregationalists in America.
But, oddly, this religious schism also resulted in a
political schism. It resulted, in short, in a separation of
the Puritans in Nova Scotia from the Puritans in the New
England Colonies. So that the Puritan colony in Nova
Scotia became a community apart, with a new and distinct
sentiment of British connection. They retained, however,
their New England ideals of responsible municipal government
and absolute religious liberty. Nova Scotia thus became
the home of a new experiment in Political and
Religious Democracy.
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But since, with the Puritans, Church or Spiritual
interests were paramount, and since the separation between
the Nova Scotia Puritans and the New England Puritans
was merely sentimental and followed the religious schism,
the Puritan literature of the period in Nova Scotia was
wholly religious and theological. On the theological side,
it took the form of controversial and polemical literature
for the promotion of the ‘New Lights’ schism. On the
religious and creative sides, it took the form of homilies,
sermons, devotional works, prayers, and hymns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief creative writer of the Puritan period was
Henry Alline. During the conflict between the Orthodox
Congregationalists and the ‘New Lights’ Henry Alline published
a polemical pamphlet, <span class='it'>The Anti-Traditionist</span>, and
five books of <span class='it'>Hymns and Spiritual Songs</span>. After his death
his <span class='it'>Life and Journal</span> was published. It is interesting only
to students of religious psychology and the varieties of
religious experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Alline’s <span class='it'>Hymns and Spiritual Songs</span> is a genuinely
creative work. It contrasts admirably with the too often
spiritually inept and doggerelized hymns and evangelical
songs that have found a place in the hymnody of the
Churches. Alline’s hymns and spiritual songs disclose on
his part an authentic lyrical faculty, a sure sense of rhythm
and of decent rhyme, and a respect for dignified diction and
imagery. Though Alline’s work in prose and verse has no
significance in the evolution of Canadian Literature, inasmuch
as he did not even ‘influence’ Canadian hymnography,
yet the literary historian must give him the distinction of
being the first of the Pioneer Hymn Writers of Canada.
The Puritan period in Nova Scotia had, however, no importance
in the development of Canadian Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The literature produced by the Loyalists in Nova
Scotia, on the other hand, was fundamental in the evolution
of Canadian Literature. For the most part, the Loyalists
were members of the cultured Tory or aristocratic families
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
of New England and the other Atlantic Colonies, and were
highly cultured themselves. Many of them were teachers,
clergymen, lawyers, jurists and officials—all graduates of
Harvard, Yale, and other leading educational institutions
in the lost colonies. The Loyalists brought with
them their social and cultural ideals; and many of
them were practised in literary expression, after the
manner of the 18th century prose and verse. They were
thus fitted by education and powers of literary expression
to reconstruct, as they did, the civilization and culture of
Nova Scotia, and to produce, as they did, the first Nativistic
Literature of Canada. How they accomplished these
creative results is an instructive study by itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the American Revolution the Loyalists were
aristocratic families with an ardent British sentiment.
They wished to retain British connection and to promote
their own institutions, with New World modifications,
modelled upon British institutions. The persecutions they
endured during the whole of the Revolutionary times and
their forced exile to Nova Scotia did but intensify their
sentiment for British connection in their new home in
Nova Scotia. Yet the love for their old homeland remained,
and became with them a rather poignant nostalgia.
It was, however, the old <span class='it'>homeland</span> they loved; but for the
<span class='it'>people</span> of the United States they had no sentiment save
scorn and hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the while, therefore, they retained in their minds
and hearts the so-called ‘United Empire’ ideal. But at
length this became a problem which took the form of an inner
debate as to whether they should cast aside all thoughts
of bringing about a re-union of British North America
(that is, the Canadas and the Maritime Provinces) and
the United States, or whether they should promote a <span class='it'>new</span>
United Empire in the land over the border from the United
States. It must be admitted, however, that on the side of
ardency of sentiment the Loyalists in Nova Scotia really
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
felt more a nostalgia for their old homeland than they felt
a love for Great Britain and the establishment of a great
British nation in the lands north of the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is this nostalgia which first finds expression in the
Loyalist literature produced in Nova Scotia; and it finds
its fullest expression in verse. Several names—Jacob
Bailey, Jonathan Sewell, Joseph Stansbury, Jonathan
O’Dell, Adam Allen, James Moody, Mather Byles, Walter
Bates—are noted by literary historians as paramount in
the early Loyalist literature. There is, however, nothing
of genuine literary merit in their poetry, prose narratives,
and diaries. Of these early Loyalist writers Jonathan
O’Dell is somewhat significant. He introduced into Nova
Scotia the verse forms and temper of the 18th century
poetic satirists, Dryden and Pope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time, at length, wrought changes in the hearts of
the Loyalists, and they began to look away from the United
States and to take a pride in their new home; to look with
affection upon Nova Scotia and to express a decent regard
for England, the Motherland. As it were, the grapes in
the United States had soured, and the Loyalists in Nova
Scotia began to look on the Revolutionists as their inferiors
in birth, culture and civilization. The true ideals, in their
view, were in the aristocratic culture and the political
system of the new Provinces and England. Once this spirit
of contempt for United States culture and civilization became
thoroughly engendered, the separation of the Loyalist
community in Nova Scotia from all United States connection
was complete. Whereupon the Loyalists felt that
the only right course to pursue was for them to unite with
the Puritan settlers who had preceded them to Nova Scotia,
and to develop a civilization and culture all their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This they proceeded to do by laying the foundations of
Journalism in Nova Scotia. The first journalistic ventures
in Nova Scotia happen also to be the first in Canada.
The first newspaper had been founded at Halifax in 1752:
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
that is, eight years before the Puritan Migration; but
it was a government organ and not a real newspaper. But
on March 17th, 1776, when the British troops evacuated
Boston, John Howe, Loyalist and printer, also left Boston
and with him went the press of the Boston <span class='it'>News-Letter</span>.
Eventually it reached Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the <span class='it'>News-Letter</span>
was amalgamated with the Halifax <span class='it'>Gazette</span>. In
1789 <span class='it'>The Nova Scotia Magazine</span> was founded, printed, and
edited by John Howe. This was the first literary magazine
published in British North America. Thus, under Loyalist
auspices and literary traditions, journalism began in Nova
Scotia, that is, in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further: Loyalist newspapers and Loyalist magazines,
founded at Halifax, and later at St. John, that is, Loyalist
Journalism, laid the foundations of literary expression and
literary creation in Canada. It is beside the point to animadvert
upon the aesthetic values of the substance and
form of the original prose and verse which appeared in the
Loyalist newspapers and magazines. For, up till the time
of Joseph Howe’s becoming sole owner and editor of <span class='it'>The
Novascotian</span>, in 1828, all the literary work that had preceded
was but a preparatory school of journalism and
literature. When <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span> was founded by
Joseph Howe, and when Thomas Chandler Haliburton, with
Howe himself and others, began to contribute to it, journalism
itself became literature, and the first Nativistic Literature
of Canada was created.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Loyalists, we must remember, though they came
from a country in which the social and political ideals were
democratic, were themselves aristocratic. When, therefore,
they bethought themselves of founding a college, their ideal
was that of a college which would preserve the curriculum
of Colleges open only to those who were well to do. The
University of King’s College was begun as an Academy at
Windsor, Nova Scotia in 1787, was granted a Collegiate
Charter in 1789, and was formally opened as a College in
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
1790. It was indeed open to all the Province—to all those
who could <span class='it'>afford</span> to attend. But in 1802 this policy of
seeming democratic inclusiveness was abrogated by an
Imperial Government Act which limited the privilege of
matriculation to members of the Church of England. Since
seventy-five per cent. of the population of Nova Scotia
were members of other communions, the great majority of
possible students were shut out from King’s College. When,
therefore, the Scots <span class='it'>émigrés</span> who settled at Pictou in 1773,
found their children debarred from education at King’s
College, they established in 1819 a new College. Education
at Pictou Academy, as it has always been called, was open
to students of all creeds, races, and color, as it is to this
day. From that Academy went forth men and women who
held up to the people of their own country and the rest
of Canada the two ideals of the supreme worth of the
individual human spirit and of sound elementary education
as the basis of constructive good citizenship. From
Pictou Academy went forth men and women who became
leaders in thought and practical endeavor in Canada—superior
teachers and presidents of Colleges, eloquent
preachers, distinguished scientists, men of practical vision
and achievement in the professions, in government and
statesmanship, and in industry and commerce. Their influence,
however, was intellectual and practical. Save in
the field of journalism, they had no influence on literature
and literary creation in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Lower Canada and in the district that became Upper
Canada, or Ontario, the earlier Loyalist Migrations brought
with them a lower level of culture than that which was
brought into the Maritime Provinces by the Loyalists who
had migrated to Nova Scotia, which at the time included
the territory that in 1784 became the Province of New
Brunswick. This is not a matter of opinion or prejudice;
it is a matter of fact. For the Loyalists who migrated
to Nova Scotia were from the most cultured families in
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
the Old Colonies, and even the men of the Loyalist Regiments
were of a superior order of character and mind. So
that the Loyalists who settled in Nova Scotia formed, as
Dr. Baker phrases it, ‘an educated class seldom found in a
pioneer community—a homogeneous community unique in
origin, with a local pride not found in other sections.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The so-called Overland Loyalists, on the other hand,
who moved into the Niagara Peninsula and into Quebec
were on the whole of humbler social status—agricultural
workers, artisans, and a considerable number of irresponsible
adventurers, who joined the Migrations in the hope
of obtaining cheap lands and something for nothing. They
were led, of course, by men of parts, but even these men
had neither literary culture nor literary interests. Their
interests were material, and they ‘headed’ a Loyalist motley
so as to have the means and labor necessary to occupy the
lands and clear them for their own materialistic ends. And
so it happened that while in Quebec and in the settlements
in the district which was to become Ontario there were
literary activities, and even newspapers and magazines, the
Overland Loyalists did not contribute constructively to the
literary spirit and the creative literature of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first genuine Nativistic Literature of Canada was
created in Nova Scotia—in the Satiric Comedy or Humor
of Haliburton, in the Sketches, Essays, Legislative Reviews,
Speeches and Public Letters and the Poetry of Joseph
Howe, and in the Poetry of Oliver Goldsmith, 2nd, a great-nephew
of the author of <span class='it'>The Deserted Village</span>. Still, this
pre-eminence given to Nova Scotia is, in a way, based on a
half-truth. It is true that, to put it colloquially, Nova
Scotia had her creative literary ‘innings’ early in the game.
It lasted from the publication of Joseph Howe’s <span class='it'>Western
Rambles</span>, in 1828, or from the publication of Haliburton’s
<span class='it'>Historical and Statistical Account of Nova Scotia</span>, in 1829,
to Haliburton’s last volume, <span class='it'>The Season Ticket</span>, published
anonymously in 1859—that is, a period of thirty years.
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were again to have
an ‘innings’ when Charles G. D. Roberts, Bliss Carman,
and Marshall Saunders, of the Systematic School of native
poets and prose writers, began publishing in the late ‘eighties’
of the 19th century. The Maritime Provinces, as a
whole, by the addition of Lucy M. Montgomery to the
native prose writers and William E. Marshall and Robert
Norwood to the native poets, had a still further short ‘innings.’
But, it must be recalled, contemporaneously with
Haliburton and Howe in Nova Scotia, certain writers in
Ontario and Quebec, namely, first, John Richardson,
Rosanna Mullins, and William Kirby, produced historical
romances, or a ‘nativistic’ literature in prose, and, later,
through the poetry of Sangster and Mair, Ontario produced
Nativistic Literature in verse. Since the rise of the Systematic
School, the centre of literary creation in Canada
has shifted from Nova Scotia to Ontario and Western
Canada.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>B</span><span class='sc'>roadly</span> taken, the Incidental Pioneer Literature of
Canada was produced by the wits and <span class='it'>bon vivants</span>
amongst the officers of the British army and navy during
or after the taking of Louisburg and Quebec, and by certain
‘birds of passage,’ British-born men and women, who
were sojourning in the Canadas. It was considerable in
quantity, embracing verse, narratives, social and nature
studies and sketches, and even fiction. But it did not
affect the life and ideals of the people. It was simply
literature produced in the Canadas—incidentally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Louisburg to Quebec and Montreal the poets in
the British navy and army exhibited a special preoccupation
with a species of war poetry. In 1759, for instance, when
the British frigate’s guns were breaching the walls of the
French stronghold, Louisburg, Valentine Neville penned
his poem <span class='it'>The Reduction of Louisburgh</span>. In 1760, George
Cockings produced another war poem for the delight of
London—<span class='it'>The Conquest of Canada</span>, or <span class='it'>The Siege of Quebec:
A Tragedy</span>. In this species of literature, the most
remarkable performance was Henry Murphy’s <span class='it'>The Conquest
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
of Quebec: An Epic Poem in Eight Books</span>. It was
published at Dublin in 1790 and runs to the amazing length
of eight thousand lines. Quantity, not literary quality,
was the only distinguishing mark of these early Canadian
poems of heroism in war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A really remarkable book, with genuine literary quality
was the elder Alexander Henry’s narrative of his experience
as a traveller and explorer, published in 1809 under
the title <span class='it'>Travels and Adventures in Canada and the Indian
Territories</span>. In point of publication it was anticipated by
narratives dating as early as 1736, when John Gyles wrote
his memoirs of <span class='it'>Odd Adventures</span>, an account of his experience
while exploring the region through which runs the
St. John River. There were many volumes of narratives,
but the most of them lacked literary style and are of interest
chiefly to the antiquarian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two women, however, deserve special notice as contributors
to the Incidental Literature of Canada. These
were Mrs. Frances Brooke, who was the wife of a chaplain
of the forces at Quebec in the last quarter of the 18th
century; and Mrs. Anna Brownell Jameson. While a
resident of the Province of Quebec, Mrs. Brooke wrote
what has been called ‘the first Canadian novel,’ <span class='it'>The History
of Emily Montague</span>. Published in 1769, it ran into several
editions. Mrs. Jameson possessed a rare pictorial sense of
beauty in nature; and while visiting the Canadas she wrote
<span class='it'>Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada</span>. Published
in three volumes at London in 1838, this work remains
to this day the finest example of ‘color writing’ in
the whole range of Canadian Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the exception of Mrs. Brooke and Mrs. Jameson,
the writers of the Incidental Pioneer Literature of Canada
merely took a passing view of what had interested them
and put it into literary form decent enough for publication.
It was the substance of what they wrote, not the style or
literary art in their books, that interested their public in
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
the Canadas, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
The only faculty these books satisfied or delighted was the
faculty of curiosity; and the only delights they really gave
readers were vicarious thrills of adventure and wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Incidental Literature of Canada, therefore, must
be merely noted as fact. In nowise, whether it be literature
or not, had it any real influence in developing a Canadian
sentiment or in awakening a Canadian literary spirit. Mrs.
Brooke wrote her novel, <span class='it'>The History of Emily Montague</span>,
strictly in imitation of the first English novelist, Samuel
Richardson. But Canadian fiction, in any real sense, did
not begin with Mrs. Brooke. It began with a native-born
Canadian, John Richardson, who wrote historical romance,
notably <span class='it'>Wacousta</span>, after the manner of, though not in
imitation of, Fenimore Cooper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the Emigré Literature of Canada we mean in general
the poetry and prose written in Canada by permanent
residents who were not born in any of the British North
American Provinces. It is a moot question whether the
literary historian should class the poetry of Isabella Valancy
Crawford and of William Henry Drummond under the
category of Emigré Canadian Literature. They were born
outside of Canada; but they came to Canada at an age
when their minds were young and unformed and readily
susceptible to Canadian influences, naturalistic, social, and
spiritual. Poets like Heavysege and John Reade came to
Canada when their minds were mature and their attitudes
to life were fixed. It is certain that Valancy Crawford and
W. H. Drummond did write from the Canadian point of
view and did influence Canadian literature, as well as contribute,
somewhat uniquely, to its quantity and quality. It
is equally certain that several of the maturely minded
<span class='it'>émigré</span> writers influenced, by their presence and example,
the development of Canadian Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the point of view of influence, both of production
and example, we include in the one category of Emigré
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
Literature the poetry and prose of the permanent residents
who came to Canada when mature in mind and of those
who came in childhood. With the exception of the poetry
of Miss Crawford and W. H. Drummond the Emigré
Literature of Canada is derivative in form and substance.
In Miss Crawford’s case we discover a considerable element
of Canadian theme and a form of her own. In the case
of Drummond we come upon what Louis Fréchette has
called a ‘Pathfinder’—a poet with a new substance and a
new form absolutely and uniquely indigenous to Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Confederation in 1867 sounded the death knell
of the Emigré Literature of Canada, actual production of
it continued for a decade or two past Confederation. It
may be said to have lasted for about a hundred years; or
from the Fall of Montreal in 1760 till the publication of
Charles G. D. Roberts’ <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span> (1887) twenty
years after Confederation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first form, it was strictly pioneer literature, and
naturally had the crudity of thought and structure which
belong to literature composed under unsettled conditions.
Gradually it came to have better aesthetic substance and
artistic form. This growth in it from crudity to decent
literary form evolved according to the social and spiritual
development of Canada in the Pioneer and the later Pre-Confederation
periods. As existence in Canada became
more and more settled, and education and culture became
more and more distributed and appreciated, the literature
produced in the country was written more and more to appeal
to the aesthetic sensibilities and the artistic conscience.
The reason for this is that when an <span class='it'>émigré</span> writer, such as
Mrs. Susanna Moodie, undertook to write social and nature
sketches, the substance counted for everything, and the
form and movement were free, unhampered by traditional
laws of expression. It was speech transcribed on paper.
But the <span class='it'>émigré</span> poets were bound by English models according
to which they must write, or not write at all. In
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
<span class='it'>émigré</span> verse, therefore, rather than in <span class='it'>émigré</span> prose, we observe
evidences of an evolution in substance and artistic
structure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Fleming came to Montreal early in the 19th century.
Suddenly his imagination grew poetic wings, and
forthwith he produced <span class='it'>An Ode of the Birthday of King
George III</span>. He made his poem as intellectualized and
stilted with imitative poetic phrases as he possibly could.
There was nothing Canadian about it. In 1830 Adam
Kidd, who came to Canada from Ireland, produced a volume
of poetry, <span class='it'>The Huron Chief and Other Poems</span>, which is
definitively Canadian in theme and is remarkable for really
engaging descriptions of Canadian scenery. It is in a traditional
English form, but from the point of view of its
substance it may be regarded as the first example of a
genuinely Canadian poem by an <span class='it'>émigré</span> writer, as distinguished
from a ‘nativistic’ writer, as, for instance, Oliver
Goldsmith, 2nd, who was born in Nova Scotia and published
<span class='it'>The Rising Village</span> in 1825.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The names and work of the <span class='it'>émigré</span> versifiers might be
extended so as to include several significant poets, such
as Charles D. Shanly, James McCarroll, Alexander McLachlan,
William Wye Smith, Thomas D’Arcy McGee and
others down to John Reade, who published <span class='it'>The Prophecy
of Merlin and Other Poems</span> in 1870. In their verse we
note a constantly increasing regard for aesthetic substance
and artistic craftsmanship. The name and work, however,
of one <span class='it'>émigré</span> poet deserves special notice, more particularly
because he is constantly being classified as a Canadian
poetic dramatist. This was Charles Heavysege.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heavysege was thirty-seven years of age when he arrived
in Canada. The accident of his having remained in
Canada and of having published at Montreal his <span class='it'>Saul</span>,
which, as a matter of fact, had been conceived in England,
does not give him as much right, if any at all, to be considered
a Canadian <span class='it'>émigré</span> poet as attaches to Kidd or Mrs.
Moodie.
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Saul</span> was published in 1857. As a poetic drama there
is no other poem which was written in Canada that is so
much in the grand manner. Its theme is Biblical, and it
is really treated with epic grandeur and romantic intensity.
But with all its excellences, it had no influence, by way of
example, on subsequent Canadian poetic dramatists, such
as Charles Mair, Wilfred Campbell, or Robert Norwood.
The first Canadian poetic dramatist, native-born, was
Charles Mair. Though the theme of his <span class='it'>Tecumseh</span> is not
so sublimated as Heavysege’s <span class='it'>Saul</span>, it is Canadian; and
though its style is not so altiloquent as that of <span class='it'>Saul</span>, Mair’s
<span class='it'>Tecumseh</span> is an original and notable contribution to the
‘nativistic’ literature of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was really, however, the later <span class='it'>émigré</span> men of letters,
particularly John Reade and George Murray, who by their
own work in verse and in literary criticism held up the
ideal of native production of worthy poetry in Canada.
They were active in the first and second decade after Confederation.
They did much to awaken the literary spirit
in Canada and to correct the literary or artistic conscience
of native-born writers. But when they had done this,
their work for Canadian Literature was at an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Archibald McLachlan came to Canada in his twenties
and he followed, in much of his writing, the themes, the
dialect, and even the stanza-forms of Robert Burns. Both
poets were intensely patriotic, both sang the gospel of the
brotherhood of man. To both life was very much a mystery,
a mystery tinged with pathos. The work of McLachlan
which may be regarded as purely Canadian in tone
and subject is found chiefly in the depiction of scenes of
pioneer life, treated objectively: <span class='it'>The Fire in the Woods</span>,
<span class='it'>The Old Hoss</span>, <span class='it'>The Backwood’s Philosopher</span>; and in <span class='it'>The
Emigrant</span> he projected a pioneer epic, which opens with an
apostrophe to Canada and traces the progress of the
emigrant from the old land to his arrival and settlement in
the new. The cutting of the first tree, the building of the
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
log-cabin and the Indian battle are successive incidents of
the poem. The style of the poem is rather formal, and recalls
Scott’s <span class='it'>Lady of the Lake</span>, but is without so much life
or color. The poet loved the spirit of freedom and independence
which he found in the new land and voiced this
love in some stirring patriotic lyrics, such as <span class='it'>Hurrah for
the New Dominion</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although William Wye Smith left Scotland in his infancy
and was for almost four score years a Canadian by
adoption, almost all his writings show the influence of the
language, the literature, the history, the religious and
philosophic spirit of his homeland. A deep spiritual note
is present in many of his lyrics. Yet he did on occasion
enter fully into the Canadian spirit and show an appreciative
understanding of Canadian conditions, the beauties of
Canadian landscape, historic themes and national aspirations.
Some of his best known poems are: <span class='it'>The Second
Concession of Deer</span>, <span class='it'>The Sheep-washing</span>, <span class='it'>Ridgeway</span>, <span class='it'>The
Burial of Brock</span>, <span class='it'>Here’s to the Land!</span>, <span class='it'>Canadians on the
Nile</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was one <span class='it'>émigré</span> poet who deserves detailed appreciation
as a creative interpreter of Western <span class='it'>chevalerie</span>
and as a lyrist with an exquisite fancy and delicate artistry.
This was Isabella Valancy Crawford. Born in Ireland in
1850, she came to Canada when but a child of eight years,
her family settling in Ontario, and, later, moving to the
Kawartha Lakes. Her father was a physician and it must
be presumed that the daughter came under cultural influences
in her home. More important is the fact she lived in
Canadian districts which must have peculiarly affected her
young, impressionable, and receptive mind. Undeniably
she was born a poet; that is to say, she was born with a
genius for seeing spiritual beauty and meaning in all common
things, natural and human. Thus gifted and thus
left free to be impressed by Canadian Nature and life
around her, and also by Nature and life in the Western
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
prairie regions, of which she had read, Valancy Crawford
set about imaginatively to interpret and express in verse
her appreciation of Nature and life in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether it was her sheer genius that created her sympathy
with pioneer and cowboy life in Western Canada, or
whether it was her imaginative sympathy with that life
that fired her poetic faculty, is a question in literary
psychology that does not here require discussion. The outstanding
fact is that Miss Crawford’s most notable faculty
was a profound sympathy with and a clear vision of the
elemental dignity of the heart of men and women whose
lot was cast in rude and unspiritualizing circumstances. It
was out of this sympathy that she was able to handle her
themes of Western <span class='it'>chevalerie</span> with a subtle, veracious, and
genuinely human but not coarse humor. Miss Crawford
saw, as no one in Canada before her or since has seen, the
poetry and the poetic or religious significance of life and
<span class='it'>chevalerie</span> in the early days in Western Canada. She took
the rude material and sublimated it, not with rhetoric, but
rather with verisimilitude of diction and phrase and imagery,
to the dignity and beauty of authentic poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We may summarize the qualities of her poetry of
Western <span class='it'>chevalerie</span>, as in her <span class='it'>Old Spookses’ Pass</span>, under
four distinctions. It is noted for dramatic (not melodramatic)
force, rugged but characteristic humor, graphic
character-drawing, and power of conveying to us the sense
of the war of the elements which is felt by the wild
creatures, such as cattle herds, who become the ‘playthings’
of those elements. The extraordinary fact is that, though
all these qualities were, on her part, sheer imaginative
invention, yet they are truer to the facts than if they had
been written by an actual eye-witness. In short, Miss
Crawford, as a poet of Western <span class='it'>chevalerie</span>, stands out as
gifted with sheer and intense imaginative power and as
an authentic imaginative creator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, her art is all authentic realism, totally free
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
from crass and hectic melodrama. Moreover, Miss Crawford
achieved, not solely because she had imagination and
a true sense of realistic values, but also because she saw
that <span class='it'>style</span> in poetry was the only antiseptic for picaresque
realism and hectic melodrama. She had genius, not merely
a tale to tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly Lowell, Bret Harte, John Hay, and others of
their school, writing in dialect, did no better work than did
Miss Crawford in <span class='it'>Old Spookses’ Pass</span>; and most certainly
Robert Service did nothing so elementally human and so
spiritualizing with his material from rude or picaresque life
in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall not wait to detail the qualities of Miss Crawford’s
art in other species of verse. We observe, however,
that her long poem <span class='it'>Malcolm’s Katie</span> is specially remarkable
for fine imagery, colorful descriptive passages, and for a
glowing impressionism which is taken directly from Canadian
Nature. Moreover, it is notable for its lyrical interludes,
which as lyrics, are as dainty and as delicately
constructed, as full of fancy and imagination in small form,
as any one of the kind in English literature. Miss
Crawford’s lyrical interlude, beginning ‘O, Love builds on
the azure sea,’ is beyond criticism, and is ‘the gem’ of several
Canadian anthologies. We quote the whole lyric:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, in 1884, Isabella Valancy Crawford’s unpretentious
little volume of poems appeared, it won high
praise from the critics of the London <span class='it'>Athenaeum</span>, <span class='it'>The Spectator</span>,
<span class='it'>The Graphic</span>, and <span class='it'>The Illustrated London News</span>.
They all noted that she had an excess of riches in fancy
and in imagination, and a poetic style of her own which
was distinguished both by beauty and exquisite artistry. In
1905 her poems were collected and edited by John W.
Garvin, B.A., and published with a critical Introduction
by Miss Ethelwyn Wetherald. This remains the definitive
edition of the poetry of Isabella Valancy Crawford, whom
Miss Wetherald describes as ‘a brilliant and fadeless figure
in the annals of Canadian literary history.’
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Canadian Emigré writers in the Pre-Confederation
period, are, then, to be appreciated by the literary historian
as men and women who, first, drew attention to the fact
that Canadian life and culture needed expression and, next,
awoke in native-born sons and daughters of the Dominion
the ambition to undertake this expression in verse and prose.
We must, therefore, honor the earlier and later <span class='it'>émigré</span>
poets and prose writers of Canada, not for the intrinsic
merit of their work, but for the fact that they engendered
in the native-born the ideal of expressing the consciousness
of a Canadian homeland and spirit in literature which
should possess originality in substance, and beauty in form

<p class='pindent'>THE NATIVISTIC LITERATURE OF CANADA—JOSEPH HOWE
AS FOUNDER OF THE INDEPENDENT PROSE, CREATIVE JOURNALISM,

ORATORY—AS PATRIOTIC, DESCRIPTIVE, AND HUMOROUS
POET—AND AS THE DISCOVERER AND SPONSOR OF THOMAS

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>he</span> epithet nativistic as applied to Canadian Literature
marks a two-fold contrast. On one side, it
distinguishes the literature written by natives of any of the
Maritime Provinces and the Canadas (Ontario and Quebec)
from the earlier Incidental or Émigré Literature. On
the other side, it distinguishes the literature written by
native-born men and women <span class='it'>before</span> Confederation from the
Native and National Literature written by native-born
poets and prosemen <span class='it'>after</span> Confederation. Nativistic
Literature is ‘native’ only in the sense of being the
indigenous product of the Unconfederated Provinces; but
it is neither ‘native’ nor ‘national’ in the sense of being the
product of the Confederated Provinces which form the
Dominion of Canada. But since this Nativistic Literature
was written by native-born sons and daughters of the
Provinces in a period when these Provinces were, so to put
it, ‘on the way’ to political union, and since it has permanent
significance, it is classified retroactively as part of the
genuine literature of Canada. Thus Richardson’s romances
(written and set in Ontario), Haliburton’s satiric comedy
(written and set in Nova Scotia), Sangster’s and Mair’s
poetry (written and set in Ontario) belong to the Nativistic
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
Literature of Canada. But the poetry of Roberts, Lampman,
Carman, Campbell, D. C. Scott, Sir Gilbert Parker,
and Pauline Johnson, and the prose fiction of Miss Marshall
Saunders, Roberts, Parker, and Scott, as well as the verse
and prose of later native-born writers, belong to the Native
and National Literature of Canada. Yet both the Nativistic
and the Native and National Literature are equally <span class='it'>Canadian</span>,
inasmuch as each expresses with beauty or truth the
spirit and life of the people and the physiognomy and
moods of Nature in her seasons in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most significant writer, at least by versatility of
genius and variety of achievement, in the history of the
Nativistic Literature of Canada, was Joseph Howe, born
at Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1804. Solely as a man of
letters, Howe must be regarded as having been, from the
point of view of Nova Scotia and of Canada, a man of
superior creative genius. He, along with Haliburton,
inaugurated the Epoch of the Independent Prose Literature
of Canada. He laid the foundations of Canadian Creative
Journalism and Canadian Political Literature. He was the
‘father’ of Canadian Literary and Forensic Oratory. He
gave fresh life and novel humorous quality to the Familiar
Sketch or Light Essay, after the manner but not in imitation
of Addison and Goldsmith. He was the first writer
in British North America to attempt the Short Story of
Mystery, and with engaging success. He was a Poet of
greater authentic genius than many other Canadian poets
who have a wider reputation. For he wrote poetry of
Nature and the Commonplace with the beauty and distinction
of Goldsmith and Burns. He infused into the
Patriotic Song a new music and what may be regarded as
the first expression of the National spirit in verse of that
species. He gave to the Convivial Song a fresh Western
‘tang’ of breeziness and genial humanity. He revitalized,
with novel originality and piquancy, the Poetry of Humor,
so originally indeed as to make his humorous poetry almost
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
a species by itself. Finally, he discovered the genius
of Thomas Chandler Haliburton, trained him, sponsored
him, and introduced him to the world as the first systematic
humorist of the Anglo-Saxon peoples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1704, or just one hundred years before the birth of
Joseph Howe, the Boston <span class='it'>News-Letter</span>, the first New England
newspaper, was established. On March 17th, 1776, or
seventy-two years after the founding of the <span class='it'>News-Letter</span>,
the press of that journal departed from Boston for Halifax,
<span class='it'>via</span> Newport, R.I., in the care of John Howe, father of
Joseph Howe; and was set up in the office of the Halifax
<span class='it'>Gazette</span>, founded in 1752, the first newspaper published in
any of the Provinces which later became the Dominion of
Canada. The <span class='it'>News-Letter</span> was amalgamated with <span class='it'>The
Gazette</span>. The latter, however, was not a genuine newspaper;
it was a governmental organ which published chiefly
military and official intelligence. The <span class='it'>News-Letter</span> was,
in our sense of the word, a genuine newspaper. On the
face of the fact, the amalgamation of the New England
and the Nova Scotia newspapers appears as a simple, unmeaningful
<span class='it'>business</span> matter. Really, however, it was an
important factor in the evolution of Canadian literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Howe was a printer, and a cultured Loyalist. He
brought to Nova Scotia two ideals. These were, first, the
ideal of the free and democratic expression of the spirit in
word and deed; and, secondly, the ideal of the expression
of thought in strictly literary form. When, therefore, the
Boston <span class='it'>News-Letter</span> was amalgamated with the Halifax
<span class='it'>Gazette</span>, Loyalist culture and journalistic ideals and practice
infected and enhanced Nova Scotian (that is, Canadian)
journalism. The amalgamation changed the scope and
quality of Canadian journalism. For in 1828 Joseph
Howe became sole owner and editor of <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span>,
and proceeded systematically, and with better effect, to put
into practice the social, journalistic, and literary ideals of
his father.
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>When Joseph Howe assumed absolute control of <span class='it'>The
Novascotian</span>, in the same year (1828) he also brought together
the band of Nova Scotia writers known as ‘The
Club.’ In the twenty years from 1828, when Howe became
active in creative journalism, to 1847, when the struggle
for Responsible Government in Nova Scotia ended and
Howe retired from <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span>, Howe raised journalism
to the dignity of literature. He achieved this in
two ways: first, by publishing in <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span> his own
and Haliburton’s original ‘Club’ prose sketches, Haliburton’s
first series of <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>, and the prose
and verse of other contemporary Nova Scotia writers; and,
secondly, by establishing, in his own narrative and descriptive
sketches, essays, legislative reviews, reported legislative
speeches, pamphlets, and public letters, a <span class='it'>new standard of
literary prose</span>. Those twenty years—1828 to 1848—may
be called the Epoch of the Independent Prose Literature of
Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The epithet, ‘independent,’ as applied to the literature
of that period in Nova Scotia means that Howe, along with
Haliburton, set up standards of prose which in substance
and style broke away from English traditions and models.
Howe’s and Haliburton’s writings were not only an indigenous
product of Nova Scotia, a <span class='it'>native</span> literature, but
also a <span class='it'>new</span> literature, absolutely independent of other
literatures—in matter, form, and style. Moreover, <span class='it'>The
Novascotian</span>, in which were published the skits, sketches,
essays, and letters of ‘The Club,’ the sketches and essays
of Howe, the first of the <span class='it'>Sam Slick</span> humorous sketches, and,
later, the texts of Howe’s literary and forensic orations and
public letters, circulated not only in the Maritime Provinces
and the Canadas but also in the United States and Great
Britain. <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span> thus introduced Howe and
Haliburton, as creative prose writers, to the literary world.
We may, therefore, mark the twenty years from 1828 to
1848 as the Epoch of the First Nativistic Literature of
Canada.
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Howe’s own creative literary work by itself deserves
particular notice, inasmuch as it was a distinct contribution
to the genuine Nativistic Literature of Canada. In 1828
Howe himself began a series of narrative and descriptive
writings, intimate, gossipy ‘genre’ and ‘color’ sketches,
which he published in <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span> and which he named
<span class='it'>Western Rambles</span>. In 1830 he followed these with a
similar series which he named <span class='it'>Eastern Rambles</span>. In 1838
and in 1839, while he and Haliburton were in Europe,
Howe published in <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span> two series of essay-like
sketches, <span class='it'>The Nova Scotian Afloat</span> and <span class='it'>The Nova
Scotian in England</span>, in which it appeared that Howe was
developing for himself a new literary style. For though
these sketches are somewhat in the manner of Goldsmith
they have a merely outward essay-like formality, but are
distinguished by an originality of their own, an inward
spirit of fresh humor and a humanity, almost urbanity,
which are wholly Howe’s own creation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another department Howe added creatively to the
prose literature of Canada. He laid the foundations of a
political literature, which was not journalism, but authentic
literature. He did this, first, by his inimitable so-called
<span class='it'>Legislative Reviews</span>, when, in 1830, he began what is admitted
by all critics to be in literary form and style a
brilliant series of discussions of public affairs. Again:
Howe enhanced the political literature of Canada by his
pamphlets, public letters and his speeches and addresses,
which were all published in the press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not, however, by his legislative reviews, pamphlets,
essays, sketches and public letters that Howe must be given
a unique status in Canadian creative prose literature. He
wins his unique status by virtue of his Speeches and Orations.
They are really ‘great’—noble in thought, beautiful
in literary style and finish, extraordinarily fine examples
of a Western reincarnation of the rhetorical and literary
gifts of such consummate parliamentarians and statesmen
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
as Edmund Burke, John Bright, and William Ewart
Gladstone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally: Howe contributed to the Nativistic creative
literature of Canada considerable journalistic verse which,
in virtue of its humanity, and sincerity, its imaginative
beauties, pleasing conceits and sentiments, and flowing
rhythms (though it lacks somewhat in original verbal
music) is quite on the plane of the journalistic verse of
the 18th century neo-classical school, especially the verse
of Goldsmith, upon which most of the verse of Howe was
modelled. Howe wrote inspiriting Imperial verse, as, for
instance, his <span class='it'>Flag of Old England</span>, a really fine example of
patriotic poetry. He wrote colorful and musical descriptive
verse, as, for instance, his long unfinished poem <span class='it'>Acadia</span>
(in the 18th century rhymed couplet). He wrote infectious
humorous poetry, as, for instance, <span class='it'>The Blue Nose</span>, <span class='it'>To Mary</span>,
<span class='it'>A Toast</span> (to Haliburton), which is as near poetry as that
species of verse ever reaches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Johnson and Goldsmith raised journalistic verse to
the plane of poetry, so did Joseph Howe. Or, concretely,
if Goldsmith’s <span class='it'>Deserted Village</span> is authentic poetry, so is
Howe’s <span class='it'>Acadia</span>. Consider this excerpt from Howe’s
<span class='it'>Acadia</span>:—</p>

<p class='noindent'>and so on. ‘Pearl of the West!’—in just as short, apt, and
felicitous poetic phrase as Goldsmith’s apostrophe ‘Sweet
Auburn!’ Howe signalizes Nova Scotia, her natural beauty
and magic, her ‘homeland’ thrall over the heart and imagination
of her native sons, a thrall of mountain, mead, and
wood, and flood, of kinship with nature and of pride in her
resources on land and sea. His <span class='it'>Acadia</span> is all authentic
poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a lyrist of the beauty and pathos of the Commonplace,
after the manner of Burns, Howe ranks well, as in
his lyrics of this species, <span class='it'>To The Linnet</span>, <span class='it'>The Deserted
Nest</span>, and <span class='it'>To the Mayflower</span> (trailing arbutus). It is,
however, as a Poet of Humor that Howe must be regarded
as somewhat unique in the literary history of Canada. For
in his humorous verse Howe does not indulge in the ludicrous
or in sheer absurdity, as did George T. Lanigan.
Rather Howe employs an unconventional method of dignifying
the human spirit, as in his playful manner of
signalizing the heart qualities of the Nova Scotian in his
poem <span class='it'>The Blue Nose</span> and in <span class='it'>A Toast</span> (to Haliburton).
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
Seldom did Howe use satire in humorous verse. But
whenever he did so, he employed the manner of Burns,
and in the form of epigram, as in <span class='it'>To Ann</span> and in this smart
epigram, <span class='it'>To a Lady (whose Eyes were Remarkably

<p class='pindent'>Joseph Howe was a ‘poet frustrate.’ Had he been able
to devote himself wholly to verse, there is no doubt that
he would have left a considerable body of authentic poetry.
The bad in his verse is like the bad in the verse of his
superiors, but the best of Howe’s verse is genuine poetry.
Yet however high or low individual critics may estimate
the aesthetic and artistic qualities of his verse, Joseph
Howe has a right to a place in the history of Canadian
poetry, and to a distinctive place in the history of Canadian
humorous poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the inaugurator of the Epoch of the Independent
Nativistic Prose Literature of Canada, as an authentic
creator of Literary Journalism and Literary and Forensic
Oratory, and as a significant, though frustrate Poet, Joseph
Howe was, as Samuel Johnson said of Goldsmith,—‘a very
great man.’</p>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>THE NATIVISTIC LITERATURE OF CANADA—THOMAS CHANDLER
HALIBURTON—FIRST SYSTEMATIC HUMORIST OF THE
ANGLO-SAXON PEOPLES—CREATOR OF A NEW TYPE OF
SATIRIC HUMOR AND COMIC CHARACTERIZATION.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>t</span> is the chief glory of Thomas Chandler Haliburton,
born at Windsor, Nova Scotia, in 1796, that he was
<span class='it'>the first systematic humorist and satirist of the Anglo-Saxon
peoples</span>. This distinction will appear as almost obvious
once its meaning and scope are properly understood.
From the founding of the American Colonies till the American
Declaration of Independence there were no Anglo-Saxon
<span class='it'>peoples</span>. Up to pre-revolutionary times the colonists
in the Maritime Provinces, in Canada, and in the Atlantic
Colonies thought of themselves as British people merely
separated from the people in the Old Country by the main
of the Atlantic. It was a separation only in geographical
distribution. The British ‘family spirit’ was still intact,
and the Old Country was still ‘over home.’ It might be
thought that there were two British peoples on the American
continent after the Fall of Montreal (1760). As a
matter of fact, the British people in the Maritime Provinces
and Canada had been, as it were, always ‘under the wing’
of the New England Colonies, at least in the sense of a
military and naval protectorate. So that after the Fall
of Montreal to the Declaration of Independence the whole
of the vast areas occupied by the British in the New World
was definitively British America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the American Declaration of Independence and
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
the revolution, there resulted in sentiment and aim a political
separation between the British people of one section
in America and the people of the Old Country. For the
first time the British ‘family spirit’ was disintegrated. In
1786, with the granting of the independence of the Atlantic
Old Colonies, a real political separation of the British in
North America was permanently established. There was
effected a separate United States and a separate British
North America (Maritime Provinces and Canada). Thus
there were, politically viewed, two Anglo-Saxon peoples in
America, and one in the United Kingdom. For the first
time in history the phrase ‘the Anglo-Saxon <span class='it'>peoples</span>’ denoted
a real distinction in political and social entities. The process
of time, of course, only increased the sense of separation
of the Anglo-Saxon peoples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unless we think of this 18th century division of the
Anglo-Saxons into three separate peoples, politically as well
as sentimentally, we shall regard Jonathan Swift as the
first systematic satiric humorist of the Anglo-Saxon peoples.
This is impossible, however, for the reason that
Swift’s satires—<span class='it'>The Tale of a Tub</span> and <span class='it'>The Battle of
The Books</span> (1704) and <span class='it'>Gulliver’s Travels</span> (1726)—were
not only written prior to the revolution in America but
also were addressed solely or specifically to the English
people of the United Kingdom. Further, Swift was not
a consciously systematic satirist. He simply wrote, as
occasion demanded, satiric <span class='it'>pièces-a-thèse</span>. For the same
reasons Laurence Sterne cannot be regarded as the first
systematic humorist of the Anglo-Saxon peoples. Sterne’s
<span class='it'>Tristram Shandy</span> (1759-67) and <span class='it'>A Sentimental Journey</span>
(1768) were published before there was a United States
Republic and a British North America as separate political
entities. When Charles Dickens published his <span class='it'>Pickwick
Papers</span> (1836-37), the Anglo-Saxon <span class='it'>peoples</span> as such—in
the United States, in British North America, and in the
United Kingdom—had been a political fact for more than
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
fifty years. Yet Dickens cannot be regarded as the first
systematic satiric humorist of the Anglo-Saxon peoples.
He definitively addressed the English people in England.
He was a benevolent humorist, aiming by comic characterization
to create sympathy with our common humanity.
He also aimed to bring about certain social reforms, but
his method was that of the kindly humorist. The satirist
aims to cause pain as a remedial measure. But, above all,
Haliburton had anticipated Dickens both in time and in
method. For <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>, with Sam Slick as the
central comic character, was published serially in <span class='it'>The
Novascotian</span> in 1835, or a year before the publication of
the first of <span class='it'>The Pickwick Papers</span>, and was in method a combination
of humor and satire, with a distinct political and
social thesis, namely, to promote a <span class='it'>zollverein</span> of the Anglo-Saxon
peoples. Dickens aimed mostly to entertain his
own people. Haliburton aimed to change the vision of
the Anglo-Saxon peoples in the United States, British
North America, and the United Kingdom, and thus, if
possible, to effect a world-wide Anglo-Saxon union or
unity. In short, Haliburton’s works in satiric humor were
not conceived and written primarily as literature, but as
social and political propaganda. The humor in them—the
‘soft sawder’—was introduced to relieve the pain of the
satiric truth just as the comic episodes in Shakespeare’s
tragedies relieve the emotional poignancy of the tragic
strain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To take this point of view about the aim and significance
of Haliburton as a satiric humorist is the first step towards
a proper approach to his humorous writings, and the only
way rightly to estimate his importance in Canadian, American,
English, and world literature. It is a simple matter
to trace the origin of his genius and to show his place and
influences on Canadian, American, and English Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Briefly, Haliburton’s satiric mood or temper was a
recrudescence of the revolutionary Loyalist mood or temper.
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
He also inherited the Loyalist love of British connection
and an antipathy to republican institutions and
civilization, as in the United States. Further, in his time
the realistic revolt against the historical romance in fiction
was under way. Born with an inherited satiric temper,
and finding to hand a great problem, namely, the effecting
of the Anglo-Saxon dream of Imperialistic unity amongst
the peoples of British origin, Haliburton decided to be a
satiric realist, and to have his satiric writings reach and
move the hearts of his compatriots in the Maritime Provinces
and Canada and of the people of the United States
and in the United Kingdom. But as a satirist he saw all
the facts with a humorous appreciation, and in presenting
the facts of life, the psychology of society, the idiosyncrasies
of peoples, political institutions and culture and
civilization, as he saw them, Haliburton decided to write
with realism and truth but without rancor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was the <span class='it'>protégé</span> of Joseph Howe; and when Howe
founded ‘The Club,’ a coterie of Nova Scotia wits, Haliburton
contributed his share of the skits in political and
personal satire for which ‘The Club’ was famous. These
skits were derivative in manner. But in 1835 Haliburton
invented a method of his own and definitively set out on his
career as a systematic humorist, presenting his thoughts,
‘as the sunny side of common sense,’ in a series of sketches
entitled <span class='it'>The Clockmaker; or The Sayings and Doings of
Sam Slick of Slickville</span>. These sketches were published in
Joseph Howe’s newspaper <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span> (1835-36).
There were twenty-three of them. These were augmented
to thirty-three, and were published in book form by Joseph
Howe, at Halifax, in 1837, and by Richard Bentley, at
London, in the same year. Bentley published a second
Series in 1838, and a third Series in 1840. Reprints appeared
in the United States, and translations in France and
Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His reputation as a satiric humorist having been made
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
by <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>, Haliburton became a thorough systematic
creative humorist, publishing <span class='it'>The Letter-Bag of the
Great Western</span> (1840), <span class='it'>The Attaché</span>; or <span class='it'>Sam Slick in
England</span> (1843-44), <span class='it'>The Old Judge</span>; or <span class='it'>Life in a Colony</span>
(1849), <span class='it'>Sam Slick’s Wise Saws and Modern Instances</span>
(1853), <span class='it'>Nature and Human Nature</span> (1855), and <span class='it'>The
Season Ticket</span> (1860). Besides these works in creative
satire and humor, Haliburton applied himself to editing
humorous works, and published <span class='it'>Traits of American Humor
by Native Authors</span> (1852), and a sequel, <span class='it'>The Americans
at Home</span> (1854). All his creative works and his compilations
of humor were published on both sides of the
Atlantic and ran into innumerable editions and pirated reprints,
and <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span> and some others were translated
into French and German. So that, on the face of
original production, Haliburton appears as the first and
foremost systematic satiric humorist of the Anglo-Saxon
peoples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The core of all his works in creative humor is some
problem of the larger politics—British Connection, Imperial
Federation, Free Trade, the Independence of the British
North American Colonies, their Annexation with the
United States, Anglo-Saxon Alliance or Union, Responsible
Government in the Maritime Provinces and the Canadas,
Confederation of the Provinces, Voting by Ballot, Universal
Suffrage. For instance, in <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span> (second
series) he presented the desirability of British connection,
but in <span class='it'>Nature and Human Nature</span> declared for the independence
of the British North American Colonies as against
their annexation with the United States, because he fancied
independence would be better for them and the motherland.
In <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span> (second series) he advocated Imperial
Federation in the form of a union or alliance of the Anglo-Saxon
peoples for reciprocal security and economic development.
But in the same work and in <span class='it'>The Attaché</span> he
opposed Responsible Government for the Colonies out of
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
a fear of mobocracy, a fear that had been engendered in
his heart by the Rebellion of 1837. An inherited prejudice
against republican institutions and a dread of mobocracy
caused him to oppose Confederation of the Provinces and
Universal Suffrage. In every one of his works of humor
or satire we find some special thesis, but chiefly satiric arguments
for the union or unity of the Anglo-Saxon peoples
to which he bends all his power of humor, satire, ridicule,
and epigram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto Haliburton’s originality and greatness have
been based on two claims. He created one of the perduring
or unique comic characters of humorous literature; and he
is regarded as the ‘father’ of American humor. Neither
of these distinctions constitutes his real originality and
greatness as a satiric humorist and man of letters. He is
really great on account of his distinct and definable influences
on three literatures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beginning with Canadian Literature, we remark that
Haliburton’s influence in Canada is popularly conceived,
not as literary, but as political. It is true that Haliburton’s
themes or theses were highly social and political. It is
also true that, so far as his humor is concerned, he was
unappreciated and even unread in Canada. It is true, still
further, that he has had no successors as a humorist in
Canada (for Stephen Leacock is not a successor, neither
being a native son nor following the method of Haliburton).
Nevertheless, Haliburton achieved two important results
for Canadian Literature. Along with Joseph Howe, Haliburton
ushered in the Epoch of the New or Independent
Prose Literature of Canada. Again: he not only produced
an original prose literature but also wrote it with such
originality and novelty of matter and style that Haliburton’s
prose, that is, Canadian prose, has a significant and permanent
place in English and World Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may sound strange or startling to learn that Haliburton’s
work in satiric humor and comic characterization
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
actually <span class='it'>displaced</span> in England the vogue of such popular
American prose writers as Irving and Cooper. The fact
is important, but the reason is more important. Between
1820 and 1840 Irving, with <span class='it'>The Sketch Book</span> and <span class='it'>Bracebridge
Hall</span>, and Cooper, with <span class='it'>The Spy</span>, <span class='it'>The Pioneers</span>, and
his <span class='it'>Leatherstocking Tales</span>, won popular appreciation in
England. By 1840 two Canadian authors, John Richardson,
with his historical romance <span class='it'>Wacousta</span>, and Thomas
Chandler Haliburton, with <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span> series, also won
popular appreciation. But Haliburton’s work was appreciated
for an altogether different reason from that which
caused the vogue of Irving, Cooper, and Richardson. The
English were caught by the <span class='it'>new matter</span> in the work of
Irving, Cooper and Richardson, but they felt that it was
all in an <span class='it'>old manner</span>, the manner respectively of Goldsmith
and Sir Walter Scott. They were reading, they felt,
<span class='it'>English</span> Literature, done by two Americans and one Canadian.
Save in mere matter and ‘properties’ there was
nothing in the work of Irving, Cooper, and Richardson that
might not have been done by a visiting Englishman who
had gone to the United States or to the Canadas for new
material and local color. It was English, not strictly
<span class='it'>original American</span>, literature. And so it had a mere vogue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, however, the English people read Haliburton’s
satiric comedy and comic characterization, they came, <span class='it'>for
the first time</span>, upon an absolute or sheer literary novelty—literature
that was <span class='it'>not</span> English, <span class='it'>not</span> English-American, <span class='it'>not</span>
English-Canadian, but an original <span class='it'>American</span> species, absolutely
new and unique. Here in Haliburton’s work was
literature in the English language, but not English in
matter, manner, or tone. Here were such novel satiric
humor, such arresting and vitalized comic characterization,
and such a strange medley of practical wisdom in moral
maxims and epigrams, and all expressed in a unique lingo,
that the like of it never was before in any literature which
had come even from America.
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At once a change took place in the minds of the English
people in England. Hitherto America had looked across
to England for fresh literature, and had based its own
literature on English models. But when Haliburton produced
a wholly original American literature, England
looked, for the first time in history, across to America both
for fresh and original literature, and for models which the
English writers might follow. At least in one instance
English humoristic literature actually modelled itself on
Haliburton. There is no argument possible in the matter.
For the fact is that Dickens did read <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>,
which appeared serially a year earlier than Dickens’ <span class='it'>Pickwick
Papers</span>, and that Sam Weller is an English version of
Haliburton’s Sam Slick (not conversely).</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a literary phenomenon by itself that Haliburton’s
work enjoyed an ‘unprecedented popularity’ in England but
also displaced in popularity the work of Irving, Cooper and
Richardson. The popularity of Haliburton’s work was not
a mere vogue. It remains to this day. His Sam Slick
has been admitted to the gallery of the chief comic characters,
not only in English, but also in world, literature—to a
place beside Sterne’s Uncle Toby, Dickens’ Pickwick and
Micawber, Cervantes’ Don Quixote, Daudet’s Tartarin,
Twain’s Huckleberry Finn. It is also a fact that Haliburton’s
epigrams and moral maxims have become part of
the English colloquial speech and at least English popular
literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most remarkable were the influences of Haliburton and
his works on American Literature. Rightly to appreciate
these influences, it is necessary to understand what Haliburton
was not. He was not, as has been alleged, ‘the
father (or founder) of American humor.’ He was not
‘the creator of the American type in literature.’ He was not
‘the first American in literature.’ His Sam Slick is not
‘the typical American.’ These alleged distinctions are half-truths
and are based on ambiguities.
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There is considerable truth and point in calling Haliburton
‘the Apostle of American Humor.’ As to progenitorship,
the fact is that Benjamin Franklin is the ‘father’
of indigenous American humor. In 1765 Franklin sent
to a London newspaper what is the first example of that
species of satiric burlesque, that preposterous or extravagant
nonsense, said with a grave air of veracity, which is accepted
as the characteristic matter and manner of American
humor. Franklin was versatile in genius and so variously
occupied in his long career that hardly can he be regarded
as systematic in any calling. Yet he was as systematic
as a humorist and satirist as he was in anything else. He
began his literary career as a humorist when, in 1722, he
contributed pseudonymously to <span class='it'>The New England Courant</span>
the series of imitative Addisonian skits known as the
‘Silence Dogood Papers.’ Seven years later, he continued
his humor in <span class='it'>The Pennsylvania Gazette</span> with the
sprightly letters of ‘Busybody,’ ‘Anthony Afterwit,’ ‘Alice
Addertongue,’ and ‘Bob Brief,’ and with satiric burlesques
in <span class='it'>A Meditation on a Quart Mug</span>, <span class='it'>A Witch Trial at Mount
Holly</span>, and other squibs. Quite systematic was the humor
of Franklin’s Prefaces to <span class='it'>Poor Richard’s Almanack</span> (1732-1758)
and of some of the aphoristic wit and wisdom in
the Almanacks when the epigrams or maxims were Franklin’s
own invention, as, for instance, ‘Never take a wife
till you have a house (and a fire) to put her in.’ Though
most of the proverbial wisdom in <span class='it'>Poor Richard</span> was borrowed,
the form and wit—the ‘Yankee smartness’—of it
were Franklin’s creation, and he became the ‘father’ of all
those New World humorists who wrote aphoristic wit and
wisdom, down to Haliburton and from Haliburton down
to Westcott (‘David Harum’). Masterpieces in mordant
satire worthy of Dean Swift are Franklin’s <span class='it'>Of the Meanes
of disposing the Enemies of Peace</span> (1760), <span class='it'>An Edict by the
King of Prussia</span> (1773), <span class='it'>Rules by which a Great Empire
may be Reduced to a Small One</span> (1773), <span class='it'>Speech of Sidi
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
Mehemet Ibrahim</span> (an ironical justification for the enslaving
of the Christians by Mohammedan Africans, 1790).
Also to be mentioned are Franklin’s <span class='it'>bagatelles</span> (1778-80),
written during his stay at Passy, France, of which the most
famous are <span class='it'>The Ephemera</span>, <span class='it'>The Story of the Whistle</span>, <span class='it'>The
Morals of Chess</span>, and <span class='it'>The Dialogue between Franklin and
the Gout</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foregoing enumeration of Franklin’s humorous
and satiric writings show that if collected in one or more
volumes they would bulk large and prove that he was very
considerable a systematic humorist. But only the Letter
of 1765 to the London Press and the four masterpieces of
irony or satiric burlesque written in 1760, 1773 and 1790
are in the manner which is recognized as the characteristic
American humor—a commingling of extravagant nonsense
and fact, uttered with such an air of veracity as to make
the passage from fact to nonsense and conversely imperceptible
and the detecting of it, on first reading, impossible.
On the side of aphoristic wit and wisdom, the work of
Franklin is indigenous, and, though in substance frequently
derived, is original in form and style. So that while we
must regard Franklin as the real ‘father’ of American
humor, we must also see wherein Haliburton is even more
original than Franklin and had an even more important
a constructive influence on American humor than had
Franklin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was meant by Artemus Ward and others who
distinguished Haliburton as ‘the ‘father’ (or ‘founder’)
of American humor,’ as the ‘creator of the American type
in literature,’ as ‘the first American in literature,’ and Haliburton’s
Sam Slick as ‘the typical American,’ was a three-fold
distinction which these formulae do not truly express.
First, Haliburton ‘naturalized’ in America a method of
humor in dialect, so that it became the method of certain
of his successors (Ward, Billings, Westcott, Dunne) and
a method of exaggeration or humorous mendacity and
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
comic characterization, so that it became the method of certain
other successors (notably Mark Twain). Secondly,
Haliburton ‘popularized’ his method of humor in dialect and
his comic characterization, especially Sam Slick, so that
they became accepted in England and Europe as peculiarly
American—the one as the indigenously original American
method of humor, and the other as the typical New
Englander, whom the English cartoonists transmuted in
caricature into ‘Uncle Sam,’ that is, into the embodiment
of <span class='it'>some</span> typical American characteristics. Thirdly, though
American (United States and British North America or
Canadian) authors, Irving, Cooper, Richardson, who were
contemporaries of Haliburton, had a vogue in England,
Haliburton had produced satiric humor and comic characterization
which were not only <span class='it'>un</span>-English in method and
conception, but also so original as to be absolutely unlike
any other humor and humorous characterization in the
world. If any literature was, in substance and manner,
strictly American, it was Haliburton’s humorous writings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In short, the ‘naturalization’ of a method of humor in
dialect—in America, and the ‘popularization’ of the chief
phases of what became accepted throughout the world as
American, though really New England, humor of thought,
speech, and character—that is what is really meant by
saying that Haliburton is the ‘father’ of American humor,
and is also his great achievement so far as he constructively
influenced American (United States) Literature. But it
is not his greatest distinction from the point of view of
creative originality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His prime originality lay neither in his dialect nor in
the creation of his chief character, Sam Slick, but in something
which is ultimate and unique in satiric genius, and
which entitles him to a place beside Swift as a subtle creator
of mordant satire. As regards the dialect and the conversational
method of narrative of his chief character Sam
Slick, the variations in morphology and phonetics, and the
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
piquancy and liveliness of it all convince one that Haliburton
independently developed the dialect or lingo of his
humorous characters. But there are facts which prove that
he developed it on a groundwork of a real New England
diction. When we compare, on the one side, the ‘Down
East’ dialect of Seba Smith’s <span class='it'>Letters of Major Downing</span>
in the Portland <span class='it'>Courier</span> (1833-34), which were imitated by
Charles Augustus Davis in the New York <span class='it'>Daily Advertiser</span>
(1835), and on the other side, the New England diction in
Lowell’s <span class='it'>Biglow Papers</span> (Boston <span class='it'>Courier</span> 1846-48; <span class='it'>Atlantic
Monthly</span> 1862-67), with the diction which Haliburton puts
into the mouth of Sam Slick, we find that Sam Slick’s
dialect is more ‘outlandish’ in morphological and phonetic
corruption than the ‘Down East’ diction in Smith’s and
Davis’ <span class='it'>Letters</span>, but nearer to the New England dialect in
Lowell’s <span class='it'>Biglow Papers</span>. Lowell, who was a scholar and
linguist, and whose own appreciation of the New England
diction is embodied in the learned disquisitions of Rev. J.
Wilbur on dialectical morphology, certainly would not burlesque
and degrade the speech of his fellow countrymen.
The dialect of Lowell’s <span class='it'>Biglow Papers</span> must be accepted
as a real, indigenous New England dialect. Haliburton
had read Smith’s <span class='it'>Letters</span>, which had circulated throughout
the Maritime Provinces, and a New England of ‘Down
East’ dialect was familiar in Nova Scotia. Haliburton’s
diction, then, in faithfulness to the real New England
diction, falls midway between the diction in Lowell’s <span class='it'>Biglow
Papers</span> and the first journalistic forms of that diction
as represented in the <span class='it'>Letters</span> of Smith and Davis. Haliburton’s
is his conception of that diction and his independent
development of it into a novel humorous dialect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the originality of Haliburton’s chief character,
Sam Slick, the truth is that the humorist created, on a
realistic basis, a transcript of the ‘composite’ order, the
main outline being derived from a real peddler-clockmaker,
named Seth, familiar in Nova Scotia, and from Haliburton’s
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
own coachman, Lennie Geldert, and a friend Judge
Peleg Wiswell, who were ‘smart’ in wit and who were
first-rate <span class='it'>raconteurs</span>. Haliburton also had as material the
stage peddler who had made his appearance in dramatic
literature as early as 1811, and who by 1830 was a stock
character of the acted drama, having the same comic
function as the stage Irishman of the late Victorian age.
Neither Sam Slick himself nor his conversational dialect
were absolute inventions of Haliburton, but were based on
a real and living dialect and character. He employed his
creative faculties in giving the one a humorous piquancy
and liveliness and the other the individuality and reality of
a real person; so that Sam Slick remains as one of the immortal
characters of fiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the slightest reflection reveals the fact that Sam
Slick is not a <span class='it'>single</span> person of many characteristics, not a
<span class='it'>type</span> of character, but a <span class='it'>composite</span> creation, the <span class='it'>epitome</span> of
so many distinct and contradictory traits that they could not
reside in a single person but only in persons. Sam Slick,
in short, was conceived and drawn to personify <span class='it'>a people</span>,
and his characteristics are an immanent criticism or
satirizing of the virtues and vices of republican democracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What is Sam Slick? He is a disreputable plebeian
creature—slangy, coarse, conceited, boastful, mendacious,
irreverent, yet shrewd, wise, practical, acute in perception
of social and political ideals, courageous, self-reliant,
quick-witted, critical of standards and values, frank in
speech, and direct in action. What does he represent?
Haliburton’s conception of <span class='it'>typical Americanism</span>. What
was he designed to achieve? Haliburton aimed to present
in the character, sayings, and doings of Sam Slick, the
<span class='it'>reductio ad absurdum</span> of republican culture, institutions and
civilization in America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>President Felton, of Harvard University, in 1842,
writing in <span class='it'>The North American Review</span>, and George William
Curtis, writing later in <span class='it'>Harper’s Magazine</span>, were only
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
partially right in attacking Haliburton for having burlesqued
and caricatured in <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>, and, particularly
in the character of Sam Slick, American culture and
civilization. It was mis-representation by sectional and
class typification; the illogic of a part for the whole. But
they were wrong in their fundamental presumption, namely,
that the English people would accept Sam Slick and his
sayings and doings as typical Americanism. Cultivated
English people no more accepted Sam Slick as the typical
American than cultivated American people accepted the
London Cockney, Sam Weller, as the typical Englishman.
What really happened was a two-fold result in literary appreciation.
That such an uncultured and socially inferior
creature as Sam Slick should appear as the social and
political critic of Anglo-Saxon institutions and civilization
struck the imagination of the English people as a most
novel and daring creation in satiric comedy, and Sam Slick
himself as the most egregiously comic figure in modern
literature. The second result was that since the English
people accepted Sam Slick and his sayings and doings as a
novelty in creative comedy and the American people took
it all as a caricature of their culture and civilization, Haliburton’s
satiric humor enjoyed, as it does to this day, an
‘unprecedented popularity’ in England but had less popularity
in the United States. Haliburton’s unprecedented
popularity in England had also the effect of causing the
English people for the first time to look across the Atlantic
to America for novel literary creation and entertainment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did Haliburton really mis-represent? Did he really
present only sectional and class culture and civilization in
America? Was he justified in choosing an obscure, socially
disreputable creature from a section of American society
to be the critic of American institutions and civilization?
Why did he not choose someone socially higher—an American
gentleman—to represent typical Americanism? The
truth is Haliburton actually did represent all phases of
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
American culture and civilization. There is the interlocutor
in <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>—the Squire, Rev. Mr. Hopewell,
and Mr. Everett, who was a real person, a president
of Harvard and a diplomat, and there are pictures of
the finer social and intellectual life of Nova Scotia and
the United States. Felton and Curtis missed all this. How
did they happen to miss it? Because Haliburton’s lesser
characters were just bits of <span class='it'>genre humor</span>, whereas Sam Slick
was such an outstandingly clear and vivid—unique—creation
in comic characterization that Felton and Curtis
saw only Sam Slick and immediately conceived him as a
mis-representation of the whole of American culture and
civilization. That they did so is a tribute to the genius
of Haliburton. For it contains the answer as to what is
Haliburton’s real originality as a creative humorist. The
answer is this: The fact that Haliburton created a composite
character, uncultured and socially inferior, to be the
supreme critic of his social and intellectual betters and
of American or republican culture, institutions, and civilization,
is an <span class='it'>absolutely original achievement in creative satire
and comic characterisation</span>. With a single stroke of genius
Haliburton places himself beside Dean Swift as a satirist,
and raises himself to the status of one of the world’s
perduring satirists and humorists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally: Haliburton influenced not only American
humorous literature but also American <span class='it'>fine</span> literature. We
note, first, the constructive influence of his editorial labors
in compiling and distributing in the United States and
other countries the best American humorous fiction, as in
his <span class='it'>Traits of American Humor</span>, and <span class='it'>The Americans at
Home</span>. Too much has been said of his influence on Artemus
Ward, Josh Billings, and other American humorists
writing in dialect in prose. But his influence on American
humor in dialect in <span class='it'>verse</span> has hardly, if at all, been rightly
or fully appreciated. Lowell came under the influence of
Haliburton in writing his humorous verse. In his <span class='it'>Biglow
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
Papers</span> Lowell not only imitated, but also actually borrowed,
ludicrous conceits and situations from <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>
series. This fact is important, because in the last
analysis Haliburton produced his humorous effects more
by grotesque conceits and ludicrous situations than by
dialect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haliburton had a potent influence also on American
journalism of his time. The newspapers reprinted ‘Yankee
Stories’ and ‘Yankee Yarns’ and ‘Letters,’ which were the
titles of pirated editions of Haliburton’s <span class='it'>The Americans at
Home</span>, and American newspaper staff humorists wrote
imitations and burlesques in the manner of Sam Slick. This
in turn influenced other American humorists, and they produced
imitations of Sam Slick, commercializing them as
‘By the Author of Sam Slick,’ knowing that thus they
guaranteed sure and large sales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be granted that Haliburton’s influence on American
romantic poetry was only accidental and pragmatic.
But the fact is that Longfellow was actually inspired to
versify the ‘story’ of the Acadian maiden Evangeline, not
when he heard a mere incident of it from Hawthorne, or
when he heard it more in detail from his own pastor, who
got it from an aunt of Haliburton, but when he read in
Haliburton’s <span class='it'>Historical and Statistical Account of Nova
Scotia</span> (1829) the full pathetic tale of the Expulsion of the
Acadians. More important is the fact that Francis Parkman
derived from his reading of Haliburton’s <span class='it'>Historical
and Statistical Account of Nova Scotia</span> his own romantic
method of writing history. So that, as far as America is
concerned, Haliburton may be called the ‘father’ of the
romantic method of writing history.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Versatility</span> of powers or genius and <span class='it'>variety</span> of literary
creation distinguish Haliburton as a man of letters. He
was a first-rate satirist or epigrammatist, narrative and
descriptive writer, anecdotist or raconteur, character-delineator,
nature-painter, and, in one respect, he was a
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
prose stylist of first rank. Such versatility is unusual and
even exceptional, and seemingly marks Haliburton as a
specially gifted writer. But Haliburton’s versatility also
exhibits certain peculiarities. Oddly, though he is saliently
the humorist or satirist or aphorist or story-teller or
descriptive writer or nature-painter or character-limner in
one or another of his works, he is, almost without exception,
all these in any work. More oddly, while a certain
gift or power predominates in a given work, all his works,
taken successively, disclose no development of powers
either in invention or in literary mechanics. There are
differences in each successive work, but only of sheer <span class='it'>variety</span>
in literary substance, not of greater and still greater advance
in novel conception and artistic handling of his matter.
Summarily: Haliburton’s gifts in humorous story-telling
and aphoristic wit and wisdom are salient in the first and
second series of <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>, <span class='it'>Wise Saws</span>, <span class='it'>Nature and
Human Nature</span>, and <span class='it'>The Season Ticket</span>. His gifts in narration
and description are salient in <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>, <span class='it'>The Attaché</span>,
and <span class='it'>The Old Judge</span>. His gifts in character-portraiture
and naturalistic description are salient in <span class='it'>The Old Judge</span>.
But if any work contains all Haliburton’s best qualities—ingenious
and unfailing invention, novel and colorful
imagination, rare perception of the humorous and ludicrous,
acute insight into human nature, and extraordinary powers
of vivid narration and realistic description—that work is
<span class='it'>The Old Judge; or, Life in a Colony</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a satirist Haliburton employed two forms—realistic
satire and humorous exaggeration or mendacity (‘tall
stories’ Haliburton called the latter). A prime example
of his realistic satire is his description of a fashionable
wedding in London; another of a ‘rube’ or bucolic wedding
in Slickville, both in <span class='it'>The Attaché</span>. In this sort of ‘take-off’
Haliburton has never been surpassed by modern journalistic
humorists. A first-rate example of Haliburton’s gifts in
humorous mendacity or burlesque is his ‘tall story’ of the
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
sale of his horse Mandarin as related in <span class='it'>Nature and Human
Nature</span>. This is the prototype of Westcott’s horse deal
burlesques in his <span class='it'>David Harum</span>. More in the manner
made familiar by Mark Twain is the humorous mendacity
of Haliburton’s tales of ‘The Gouging School’ and ‘The
Black Stole,’ both in <span class='it'>The Attaché</span>. There are anticipations
a-plenty of the Mark Twain manner of ironic exaggeration
and mordant satire in the second series of <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>,
<span class='it'>The Old Judge</span>, and <span class='it'>The Season Ticket</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a Humorist Haliburton obtained his effects—and
won his popularity with all classes—by character typification,
story-telling, aphorisms, epigrams, and homely moral
maxims, jests, waggish conceits, jocular phrases, and puns,
including <span class='it'>double entendres</span>. He employed two methods of
character typification; one being humorous definition; the
other, humorous classification. Almost all Haliburton’s
characters have names that are essentially what we mean
by nick-names, to indicate distinctive mental or moral
qualities of the individuals. It is by this method, rather
than by character-drawing, that Haliburton succeeded in
individualizing each character. It is the method of individualization
by suggestion. The name Sam <span class='it'>Slick</span>, for
instance, at once conveys the type of individual or character,
namely, the kind of person who ‘lives by his wits,’ who
gains profit by subtle or sharp practice. Such a person is
‘slick,’ an epithet derived by a vulgar pronounciation of
the adjective ‘sleek.’ Other instances are The Honourable
Lucifer <span class='it'>Wolfe</span>, The Honourable Alden <span class='it'>Gobble</span>, General
Conrad <span class='it'>Corncob</span>, Captain Ebeneezer <span class='it'>Fathom</span>, Mr. <span class='it'>Pettifog</span>
the Justice, <span class='it'>Nabb</span> the police constable, Deacon <span class='it'>Flint</span>, Rev.
Joshua <span class='it'>Hopewell</span>, Dr. <span class='it'>Query</span>, and Old <span class='it'>Blowhard</span>. The
moral connotations of these nick-names are obvious, but
Haliburton himself in the proper place always names the
character and adds a summary of moral qualities to show
the aptness of the name and its connotation. The Honourable
Alden Gobble is satirically or humorously thus named
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
because he was ‘dyspeptic and suffered great oneasiness
arter [and from] eatin’.’ A signal example of Haliburton’s
method of typification by humorous classification is found
in <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>, (third series, chapter 13). There he
classifies patriots into ‘rebel patriots, mahogany patriots,
spooney patriots, place patriots, and raal genu<span class='it'>ine</span> patriots.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>General popular character types which are familiar in
American humor indubitably had their prototypes in Haliburton’s
characters. Sam Slick, as a horse trader, is the
prototype of David Harum; and, as an aphorist and practical
philosopher, is the prototype of Mr. Dooley. Mrs.
Figg in Haliburton’s <span class='it'>Letter-Bag</span> is the prototype of Shillaber’s
Mrs. Partington. In the same work Haliburton
has an ‘enfant terrible’ who is the prototype of Peck’s ‘Bad
Boy’ and of later examples of ‘awful children,’ down to
Tarkington’s Penrod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haliburton was an egregious punster, and he even indulged
in <span class='it'>double entendres</span> which were coarse and sometimes
obscene, but which may be excused on account of
their humorous point or satiric wit. As an anecdotist,
‘spinner of yarns,’ ‘tall stories,’ ‘stretchers,’ with a decided
tendency to employ the coarse and irreverent, Haliburton
anticipated similar traits in Mark Twain, as in Twain’s
<span class='it'>Roughing It</span> and <span class='it'>Innocents Abroad</span>. Haliburton’s occasional
coarseness and irreverence are to be explained by
his hatred of sham and insincerity, of conventionalized
prudery, of concealed indecency of thought, of the real
evil caused by men and women who are outwardly ‘whited
sepulchres.’ It must, however, be admitted that, traceable
to his Border Scots ancestry, there was in him a love of
plebeian or coarse fun for its own sake. But it must also
be said that his coarseness of wit was never based on impurity
of heart, and that he had the highest respect for the
moral beauty and dignity of womanhood. He did remark
playfully the engaging vanities and foibles of women, but
for pure love and motherhood and all the sweet charities of
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
woman he had the finest and tenderest respect. Unsurpassed
in world literature is Haliburton’s tender and holy sublimation
of woman’s spiritual winsomeness and dignity, as
in this immortal metaphor:—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>A woman has two smiles which an angel might envy; the
smile that accepts a lover before the words are uttered, and
the smile that lights on the first-born baby and assures him of
a mother’s love.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As to the original humor of Haliburton’s ingenious
metaphors, similes, outlandish coinage of expressive word
morphology (such as ‘absquotulate,’ ‘spiflicate,’ ‘conflustigation,’
‘conniption fit,’ reechoed in Artemus Ward and Josh
Billings), and of his wealth of aphoristic wit and wisdom,
so much are they in the permanent warp and woof of the
popular literature of humor and of common speech that
they need not here be specially remarked and illustrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there is one matter in which Haliburton has not
been properly appreciated, and which demands fresh treatment.
He has been charged with a lack of prose style.
The truth is that Haliburton not only wrote with a positive
Theory of Style in mind, but also anticipated Matthew
Arnold and Herbert Spencer by actually publishing his
theory or philosophy of prose style. Those who criticized
Haliburton as a stylist did so without knowing that he had
actually applied a definite theory of style to his structure
and color. From that point of view, the critics of Haliburton
as a stylist were irrelevant. But they also missed
or ignored the fact that he was, if infrequently, a master
of descriptive prose style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haliburton formulates his theory of prose style in two
works—in <span class='it'>The Attaché</span>, and in <span class='it'>Wise Saws</span> (chapter
19). The first work contains his ‘Apologia’ for his
<span class='it'>utilitarian</span> style; the second briefly explains the <span class='it'>psychology</span>
of his style. The ‘Apologia’ justifies, as Matthew
Arnold would have justified, a certain promiscuity and rise
and fall in his style; the second work anticipates Spencer’s
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
philosophy of the conservation of mental energies as applied
to particular styles. Haliburton himself distinguishes
between his conversational, colloquial, humoristic—his
consciously <span class='it'>utilitarian</span>—style, and his artificial or literary—his
<span class='it'>aesthetic</span>—style as in his descriptive prose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>The Attaché</span> he points out, in what we have called his
‘Apologia,’ that his aims, which were utilitarian, did not
call for either architectonic skill or verbal artistry, but that
his colloquial, loose, prolix, promiscuous, repetitious, diffuse,
and digressive style in <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span> and <span class='it'>The Attaché</span>
was inevitable and was consciously adopted as best fitted
to the heterogeneous themes or matter of these works.
‘Prolixity,’ he adds, ‘was unavoidable from another cause.
In order to attain my [practical] objects, I found it expedient
so to intermingle humor with the several topics as
to render subjects attractive that in themselves are generally
considered too deep and dry for general reading.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>In particular, Haliburton justifies his sentential structure
on psychological grounds. In <span class='it'>Wise Saws</span> he says that
he purposely designed the structure and rhythms of his
sentences so that their length and abrupt translations would
spur the mind to attention, and that he employed a conversational
style and dialogue to create interest and keep
the attention alive. He wished his works, since they had
a utilitarian end, to be read by all classes. He resolved to
adapt the style of his works to assuring their popularity—‘in
the parlor and the kitchen.’ His themes were discursive
and therefore he resolved that the stylistic treatment should
be discursive. So Haliburton consciously employed a style
which, by novelty of dress, by being written in natural
language and illustrated with droll humor, and which by
colloquial sentential structure would, like ‘oral chat,’ sustain
interest or excite attention, and inevitably be read in
the parlor and the kitchen. ‘Why is it,’ asks Sam Slick in
the <span class='it'>Wise Saws</span>, ‘if you <span class='it'>read</span> a book to a man you set him
asleep? Just because it is a book and the language ain’t
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
common. Why is it if you <span class='it'>talk</span> to him he will sit up all
night with you? Just because it’s talk, the language of
natur’.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haliburton’s humoristic or utilitarian prose style is
justified, as he himself justified it, by its successful adaption
of means to end. In his ‘Apologia’ he noted the ‘unprecedented
circulation’ of his works on ‘both sides of the
Atlantic.’ He wrote <span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span> in a people’s style
for people’s ends, and the style, in his own view, admirably
succeeded. We must therefore hold that academic criticism
which scores Haliburton’s humoristic style on the
ground that it is loose, prolix, repetitious, digressive, vulgar,
colloquial, that it is not ‘<span class='it'>fine</span> style,’ commits the fallacy
of irrelevant conclusion. In the writing of humoristic,
utilitarian, conversational style, precisely adapted to its end,
Haliburton was a master. But he was also, at least on
occasion or whenever he essayed fine style, as in his descriptive
prose, especially of Nature, an artist of first rank,
worthy of a place beside Ruskin, Stevenson, and Hardy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards Haliburton’s aesthetic style we may instance
as example of graphic realism in ‘local color’ his description
of the dress and characteristics of an Acadian people
(<span class='it'>Nature and Human Nature</span>) and of a Low German people
(<span class='it'>The Old Judge</span>). An example of his fine artistry in
painting social life is his idyllic picture of the home of
Captain Collingwood’s sister, Aunt Thankful (<span class='it'>Wise Saws</span>).
As a picture of the sweet and gracious social life in old
colonial days, it is a masterpiece. But for sheer pathos of
‘thoughts that lie too deep for tears,’ Haliburton’s description
of the Duke of Kent’s Lodge, against a background of
Nature (<span class='it'>The Clockmaker</span>, third series), is worthy of Ruskin
or Hardy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Haliburton’s <span class='it'>forte</span> in descriptive prose was naturalistic
impressionism. In the technique of nature-painting
Haliburton employed the whole palette of pigmentation,
but especially the color-tones of carmines, yellows, greens,
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
citrons, indigos, with white and black. His description of
a Silver Thaw in February in Nova Scotia (<span class='it'>The Old Judge</span>)
is unsurpassed in literature, and, if the authorship were
unknown, might be mistaken for a bit of aesthetic prose by
Ruskin:—</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>This morning I accompanied the Judge and Miss Sandford in their
sleigh on an excursion into the country. The scene, though rather
painful to the eyes, was indescribably brilliant and beautiful. There
had been, during last night and part of yesterday, a slight thaw, accompanied
by a cold fine rain that froze, the moment it fell, into ice
of the purest crystal. Every deciduous tree was covered with this
glittering coating and looked in the distance like an enormous though
graceful bunch of feathers; while, on nearer approach, it resembled,
with its limbs now bending under the heavy weight of the transparent
incrustation, a dazzling chandelier. The open fields, covered with a
rough but hardened surface of snow, glistened in the sun as if
thickly strewed with the largest diamonds; and every rail of the
wooden fences in this general profusion of ornaments was decorated
with a delicate fringe of pendent ice that radiated like burnished
silver. The heavy and sombre spruce, loaded with snow, rejoiced in
a green old age. Having its massy shape relieved by strong and
numerous lights, it gained in grace, what it lost in strength, and stood
erect among its drooping neighbors, venerable but vigorous, the hoary
forefather of the wood. The tall and slender poplar and white
birch .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bent their heads gracefully to the ground under the unusual
burden, and formed fanciful arches which the frost encircled with
numerous wreaths of pearls.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The boles of the different trees and
their limbs appeared through the transparent ice; and the rays of the
sun, as they fell on them, invested them with all the hues of the
prism.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In that passage, besides realistic impressionism or color-writing,
we find first rate <span class='it'>style</span> in composition—artistic
sentential structure and rhythmical periods, along with
pure and dignified diction. In all Haliburton’s works
we can find passages which show his firm grip on the technique
of prose style, and a special power of vivifying his
description and color-impressionism with psychological
suggestion that enhances the effect on the sensibilities and
imagination. In all literature the allurement of sylvan
summer in Nova Scotia or Canada is not more winningly
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
or colorfully presented than in Haliburton’s impressionistic
idyll ‘A Day on the Lake’ (<span class='it'>Nature and Human Nature</span>).
In psychological suggestion the acme has been attained by
Haliburton in his descriptive sketches, ‘A Hot Day’ (<span class='it'>Wise
Saws</span>) and ‘Inky Dell’ (<span class='it'>The Old Judge</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whoever charges that Haliburton lacks style errs either
by irrelevancy or by making the wrong accusation. It is
not style that Haliburton lacks; for he has two styles, each
of which is right in the right place—a conversational style
for conveying unpopular practical ideas in a popular way,
and an aesthetic style for conveying ideas which are delightful
in themselves as beautiful pictures of Social Life
and of Nature. What Haliburton really lacked was
architectonic skill—the power of designing artistic structural
unity and plot. This is best illustrated by his
character-delineation. His major characters have not
character-unity but characteristics or character-promiscuity.
Sam Slick, for instance, is never <span class='it'>one</span> character as Micawber
or Swiveller in Dickens’ gallery is one character, unmistakably
and always. Sam Slick is a ‘mass of contradictions.’
Neither is the Rev. Joshua Hopewell a unity—speaking
and acting, that is, consistently with one character.
Yet they have a unity. How do they get it? It
is not a moral but the <span class='it'>functional</span> unity of <span class='it'>Spokesmen</span> of
Haliburton’s ideas. The reason that Slick and Hopewell
have so much promiscuity of character is that Haliburton,
as he pleased and without any regard to consistency, made
Slick and Hopewell and any other of his major <span class='it'>dramatis
personae</span> the Spokesmen of his various thoughts or ideas.
He ‘picked on’ Slick for the mouthpiece of this idea, and
Hopewell for the mouthpiece of another idea, without ever
asking if the speech he put into the mouth of Slick was
consistent with Slick’s mental and moral character, or if
the speech he put into the mouth of Hopewell was consistent
with Hopewell’s intellectual and moral character.
The result is that Slick, as we read Haliburton, has ideas,
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
makes speeches, and relates experiences that are impossible
in one of his culture and knowledge; and so with Hopewell
and others. In short, Haliburton’s major characters are
<span class='it'>puppets</span>, <span class='it'>marionettes</span>. Back of them is the Showman,
Haliburton; and the speeches we hear are not theirs but
‘their master’s voice.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oddly, Haliburton himself maintained in <span class='it'>The Old
Judge</span> that this was not a defect in character-delineation or
in artistry but was made necessary by his practical aim and
the content of his thought. The promiscuous structure of
his themes and composition or style and the promiscuousness,
or lack of unity, in his characters correspond to the
content and movement of his thought—which was swarming
with ideas, full of details of all sorts, loose, and diffuse,
bent on expressing at all hazards his ideas and opinions on
matters of practical import, and not on creating fine literature.
The purpose of his writings, he declared, was to inform
and to amuse while informing. His humor was
designed and manufactured as the sugar-coating of his
social and political ideas. Consequently, the only unity his
characters have is the thread that runs through <span class='it'>his</span>
thought; their speeches, jests, anecdotes, aphorisms, and
moral maxims are but <span class='it'>his</span> facts, ideas, opinions, strung
on the various <span class='it'>dramatis personae</span>. Thus inevitably, so
Haliburton submitted, his works and their style appear
prolix, repetitious, diffuse, digressive, and lack artistic
unity. Still they each have their own unity of essential
thought; his characters have unity of function; his style,
unity of propriety—and the whole, unity of purpose, meaning,
and achievement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haliburton consciously conceived a noble ideal. As a
man of letters he aimed to bring about an alliance or
<span class='it'>zollverein</span> of the Anglo-Saxon peoples. To do this he employed
an original method of satiric humor and comic
characterization. He was unmistakably a great satirist,
and the first and foremost systematic satiric humorist of the
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
Anglo-Saxon peoples. This is his chief glory. But while
he thus was the first native-born writer to bring Canadian
literature into a high and permanent place in English and
world literature, he also was coadjutor with Howe in inaugurating
the Epoch of the Independent Prose Literature
of Canada. Considered from the sides of versatility of
invention, variety of production in literary species, and of
mastery of style, Thomas Chandler Haliburton remains to
this day the Greatest Prose Writer of Canada. Yet, at
the same time, his achievements in creative satiric comedy
and comic characterization stamp his genius and work as
not for a single country or a specific age, but for all time
and the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE NATIVISTIC LITERATURE OF CANADA—THE HISTORICAL
ROMANCERS—JOHN RICHARDSON—ROSANNA MULLINS—AND
OTHERS. THE POETS—GOLDSMITH—SANGSTER—MAIR.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span><span class='sc'>ativistic</span> romantic fiction in Canada begins with
the historical novels of Major John Richardson. In
1832 he published his <span class='it'>Wacousta; or, The Prophecy</span>; and in
1840 its sequel, <span class='it'>The Canadian Brothers; or, The Prophecy
Fulfilled</span>. These are authentic novels of the romantic
type, having, as they do, respectably constructed plots, and
being filled with the romance of the passion of love,
heightened with thrilling adventure and incident, and colored
with pictures of aboriginal character and life against
a background of Nature in the wild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richardson was born near Niagara Falls, in 1796 (in
the same year as Thomas Chandler Haliburton, and seven
years after James Fenimore Cooper). He spent his childhood
and early adolescent days, till he was sixteen years of
age, that is, up to the outbreak of the War of 1812, in the
vicinity of the Falls and in Detroit. Then, although but a
mere lad, he enlisted in Brock’s army. Up to that time
young Richardson, during his most impressionable and
receptive years, was entertained by his grandparents and
parents with tales of Pontiac’s siege of Detroit, and with
stories of the thrilling, romantic, and tragic events in the
history of the Niagara and Detroit districts—events which
were surely amongst the most enthralling and stirring in
the vividly romantic history of Canada and the United
States. Those early days of Richardson’s were thus replete
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
with rare and unique formative influences. They created
in him the love of romance, of the heroic past of his own
country, and, later, when he came to write, furnished him
with the inspiration and the material for authentic Canadian
historical novels or romances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two other formative influences, besides those exercised
over his heart and imagination by his grandparents and
parents, determined Richardson’s genius, inspiration, and
creative method. In the war of 1812 he had fought side
by side with the noble Indian warrior Tecumseh. Further:
Richardson, on his own confession, had, as he put it, ‘absolutely
devoured three times’ Cooper’s Indian romance,
<span class='it'>The Last of the Mohicans</span>. Some critics, therefore, hold
that Richardson was a mere imitator of Cooper; that, first,
Richardson studied the mind, and character, and ways of
Indians at second-hand in the pages of Cooper’s romance;
and that, secondly, Richardson acquired from Cooper’s
novel the art or craft, the mechanics, of writing fiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the view that Richardson got his knowledge of
Indian mind and character from Cooper, there is no ground
in historical fact. The War of 1812, during which Richardson
fought side by side with Tecumseh and his Indians,
began fourteen years before the publication of <span class='it'>The Last of
the Mohicans</span> (1826), or long before Richardson could have
read a page of Cooper. Richardson’s imagination was
romantically formed in his early days when, during his
association with Tecumseh, he came to know Indian
psychology and character at first-hand. That is indisputable
fact. For the view that Richardson acquired the technique
of novel-writing from reading Cooper, there is some
justification. It is highly probable that by his reading of
<span class='it'>The Last of the Mohicans</span>, Richardson really got some
‘coaching’ in the mechanics of writing romance. But this
concession fails to prove that Richardson was a mere
imitator of Cooper and not a genuinely independent creator.
Internal evidences point to independence. For when we
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
compare the diction, the sentential structure, the descriptive
epithets and imagery, and the general style of the two
romancers, Richardson appears, except as a plot-maker, the
superior of Cooper as a craftsman and stylist. It is proof
presumptive that on the whole the Canadian romancer developed
independently his literary technique. Moreover,
in the fine art of character-drawing, Richardson is more
veracious and incisive—a better artist—than Cooper. When
we compare the American novelist’s Indian characters with
those of the Canadian, we discover that Cooper’s are more
like ‘studies’ from books than pictures from real life,
whereas Richardson’s Indians are very near to the real
Indian, very lifelike. The heroic in them is heroic enough;
that is to say, human and natural. Richardson’s Indian
characters, then, are original creations—absolutely his own.
Also his own are his other characters (soldiers, fur-traders,
French-Canadians, and the rest of the motley),
his plots, all the stirring incidents, and the ‘color’ of the
Canadian background from nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of his romances, <span class='it'>Wacousta</span>, and <span class='it'>The Canadian Brothers</span>,
the only aesthetic criticisms worth while making are that
not infrequently Richardson forces the dramatic in them
into the melodramatic, that he puts into the mouths of his
characters utterances which are unnatural or not in keeping
with the position and circumstances of the speakers, and
that he suits his historical facts to his own purposes.
Sometimes, too, construction and development are sacrificed
to the ‘theatrical’ in situation, to over-drawing of
character, and to ‘color-writing.’ <span class='it'>The Canadian Brothers</span>
has these defects in a larger degree than <span class='it'>Wacousta</span>. Yet,
on the whole, Richardson’s two chief romances are aesthetically
satisfying, and are clean, strong, wholesome, and
engaging—quite deserving of a place in permanent creative
literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Summarily: since Richardson had his genius romantically
formed, and had engaged in the art of fiction, long
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
before he had read Cooper, the only possible influence
Cooper could have had on Richardson was to incite him
to emulate the American romancer. Emulation incited by
a contemporary author does not imply imitation, and has
no significance in original literary creation. Taken, then,
by and large, John Richardson had first-rate powers of
invention, and was a respectable literary craftsman. He
was not a great novelist, but he was sufficiently great as a
creator of historical romances to produce novels which
have been read during almost a century since publication,
and are still read, along with Kirby’s and Sir Gilbert
Parker’s historical romances of life and love and heroism
in far-off days in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, if not in <span class='it'>Wacousta</span>, at least in <span class='it'>The Canadian
Brothers</span> Richardson embodied in romantic fiction, as
Sangster and Mair did in poetry, the first incipient expression
of the spirit of Canadian nationality. Both on
account of the superior inherent qualities of Richardson’s
romances as creative fiction, and on account of their containing
the earliest expression of the embryonic spirit of
Canadian nationality, Richardson must be marked as of
first-rate importance in the literary history of Canada. He
was indeed the creator of the Canadian nativistic historical
romance as Haliburton was the creator of the nativistic
fiction of satiric comedy and comic characterization. In
truth it may be said that if all Canadian imaginative prose
were lost, save the romances of Richardson and the satiric
comedy of Haliburton, Canada would still have a
literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Literary Garland</span> (1838-51) had considerable to
do with promoting letters in Canada, especially by encouraging
native-born writers. Amongst those who contributed
to <span class='it'>The Literary Garland</span> was a young girl, Rosanna
Eleanor Mullins, a native of Montreal, who, in time, became
the wife of J. L. Leprohon, also a native of Quebec.
Rosanna Mullins’ first novel, <span class='it'>Ida Beresford</span>, was written
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
when the author was but sixteen years of age, and was
published serially in <span class='it'>The Literary Garland</span>, in 1848. In
1859 she published <span class='it'>The Manor House of de Villerai</span>, and
in 1864, <span class='it'>Antoinette de Mirecourt</span>, and has several other
novels to her credit. Her characters, properties, and settings
are largely Canadian, and she evidently set out consciously
to create a nativistic literature by writing romances
which should definitively portray life and manners in the
society of the Old French <span class='it'>Régime</span> and after the Fall of
Quebec and Montreal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, Rosanna Mullins, much more than Richardson,
was inspired by a desire to express the incipient national
spirit of Canada. In <span class='it'>The Canadian Brothers</span> Richardson
disclosed an <span class='it'>awakening</span> consciousness in himself of a sense
of the spirit of nationality. Miss Mullins, on the other
hand, was the first Canadian novelist to have a <span class='it'>distinct</span>
consciousness of that spirit and to desire to express it for
its own sake. It is from this point of view, rather than
from the point of view of intrinsic literary merit, that Miss
Mullins’ romances have a right to a permanent place in the
nativistic literature of Canada. Technically she wrote with
a finer pointed stylus than Richardson—with more grace
and a finer limning of character, and with a more engaging
urbanity. In fact, her style was informed by an Irish
and French humaneness that made her work as popular with
the French-Canadians (for whom several of her novels
had been translated into French) as with the English-Canadian
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rosanna Mullins is entitled to another distinction. On
the side of nationality she disputes with William Kirby the
right of primacy in calling the attention of the later Canadian
romancers, especially Sir Gilbert Parker, to the wealth
of novelistic material that lay in the life and manners and
culture of society under the old French <span class='it'>Régime</span> and the
Occupation. For Kirby was foreign-born, whereas Rosanna
Mullins was native-born. As a matter of fact, however,
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
it was Kirby’s romantic fiction that opened the eyes of later
Canadian novelists to the abounding material for novelistic
treatment that lay in the social and political history of the
Canadian past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>William Kirby was born in England, but came to
Canada in 1832, the year which saw the publication of
Richardson’s <span class='it'>Wacousta</span>. He was then but fifteen years of
age and his mind unformed. He lived for the greater part
of his life at Niagara. So that from his fifteenth year
onwards, having taken a deep and special interest in Canadian
history and civilization, Kirby really formed his mind
and imagination on Canadian ideals and absorbed the
Canadian nationalistic spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His historical romance <span class='it'>The Golden Dog</span>, which was
published in 1877, or ten years after Confederation, really
belongs to the <span class='it'>émigré</span> literature of Canada. But because of
its constructive and inspirational influences on certain members
of the Systematic School of Canadian fictionists, in
particular on Sir Gilbert Parker, and because Kirby,
though foreign-born, was in spirit essentially a genuine
Canadian man of letters, we must regard <span class='it'>The Golden Dog</span>
as more important in the <span class='it'>development</span> of Canadian fiction
than are Richardson’s and Rosanna Mullins’ romances, and
as worthy of a more significant status in Canadian creative
literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Summarily: <span class='it'>Wacousta</span> and <span class='it'>The Golden Dog</span> were the
literary progenitors of a series of romances which have a
Canadian historical basis and which are Canadian in incident
and color. As to his creative and artistic powers, Kirby was
a finer artist than Richardson, in plot-making and character-drawing.
But, in view of certain faults—a somewhat too
theatrical grand manner in character-drawing and a too
great indulgence of his notable gifts in color-writing, Kirby
and Richardson may be classed as equal sinners.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Golden Dog</span> is, aesthetically and artistically, that
is, in plot-making, character-drawing, and in sustaining
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
interest, superior to <span class='it'>Wacousta</span> as an historical romance.
Still <span class='it'>The Golden Dog</span> is a genuinely great novel—great
inherently as an imaginative and artistic creation, and great
as the progenitor of the romantic fiction of Parker, Roberts,
Campbell, Saunders and other creators of the native and
national fiction of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>James De Mille, who was born in New Brunswick, also
must be considered as a creator of Canadian Nativistic
Literature. De Mille was a prolific writer of mysterious,
thrilling, extravagant, and sentimental fiction, showing the
influence of such masters in those genres as Poe and Wilkie
Collins. De Mille certainly possessed a creative imagination
of his own, was considerable of an artist in plot-making
and in sustaining interest, and had a distinct
sense of dramatic values, which saves such an extravagant
tale of adventure as his <span class='it'>A Strange Manuscript found in a
Copper Cylinder</span> from developing into the merely grotesque
and sensational. But because the settings of his novels and
tales are not Canadian, and because they in nowise express
anything of the growing sense of the Canadian national
spirit, they are not, on that side, significant in the literary
history of Canada. They merely increase the quantity of
Canadian Nativistic Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we have regard for the historic process in all spiritual
and social achievements, and ask: What was it that, on the
psychological or spiritual side, brought about Responsible
Government in the various Provinces that came to form
the original Dominion of Canada, and What was it that
brought about Confederation? we must answer that the
people in the British North American Provinces were
gradually coming to see themselves, their country, civilization,
and institutions from the <span class='it'>Canadian point of view</span>,
and were gradually expressing, with more and more of
conscious fervor and power, in prose and poetry, their
growing interest in and love of Canada and the Canadian
point of view. The nativistic prose writers expressed the
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
growing spirit of ‘Canada First,’ as in the writings of
Haliburton and Howe, and also in the romances of
Richardson, Rosanna Mullins, and Kirby. We turn to
observe how the spirit of national ideals was gradually
expressed in the work of the nativistic poets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nativistic poetry in Canada did not take form till the
last year of the first quarter of the 19th century. In 1825
Oliver Goldsmith, a great-nephew of the author of <span class='it'>The
Deserted Village</span>, published his idyll or descriptive poem,
<span class='it'>The Rising Village</span>. Oliver Goldsmith was born at Annapolis
Royal, Nova Scotia, in 1781, and died at Liverpool,
England, in 1861, after a long official service in his native
country. <span class='it'>The Rising Village</span>, in substance or theme, aimed
to describe the habitat, sufferings, achievements, and prospects
of the Loyalist settlers. As regards its matter,
therefore, the poem has the semblance of a genuine Canadian
poem. But the form, the metre, rhythm, and rhyme, the
diction and imagery, the characters and the settings, and
even the ‘properties,’ are in slavish imitation of the elder
Goldsmith’s idyll of ‘Sweet Auburn’ in Ireland. That is
to say, the Nova Scotian’s Muse is not the Nova Scotian
or the Canadian but the British Muse transplanted. Moreover,
<span class='it'>The Rising Village</span> is to be distinguished from Howe’s
<span class='it'>Acadia</span> in that Howe, though imitating the form and manner
of the elder Goldsmith, expresses his love of his
homeland, Nova Scotia, whereas the younger Goldsmith,
though a Nova Scotian, fills his poem with an unpatriotic
nostalgia. He loves the land where there is some ‘Sweet
Auburn,’ not his native land which he describes as ‘bleak
and desert.’ The nostalgia is real and pervasive—so much
so that he removes to England and there dies. But since
it is a poem of the habitat and experiences of the Loyalist
settlers in Nova Scotia, and since it is correct in versification
and is musical and possesses naturalistic truth, <span class='it'>The
Rising Village</span> may be regarded as a genuine poem of
<span class='it'>documentary</span> value, and as the beginning of Canadian
nativistic poetry.
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The strictly Canadian ‘note’ in nativistic poetry is first
clearly heard in the verse of Charles Sangster. He was
born near Kingston, Ontario, in 1822, and published <span class='it'>The
St. Lawrence and the Saguenay, and Other Poems</span>, in 1856,
and <span class='it'>Hesperus and Other Poems</span> in 1860. The title poem
of the first volume is in the Spenserian stanza as employed
by Byron and is also otherwise imitative. But it is distinctly
Canadian in its lyrical interludes, in which there is
a poetic <span class='it'>abandon</span>, to the beauty and magic of Nature in
Canada, as, for instance, in Sangster’s <span class='it'>Lyric to the Isles</span>,
beginning:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faulty as Sangster’s first poems are in versification and
derivative in diction, we must mark his lyrical interludes,
as in the foregoing example, as expressing a <span class='it'>new</span> note, <span class='it'>the</span>
Canadian note in Canadian poetry. It is, however, a
<span class='it'>nature</span> note, not or hardly the <span class='it'>national</span> note—clear and
confident and strong. In Sangster’s second volume, <span class='it'>Hesperus
and Other Poems</span>, published just seven years before
Confederation, we hear the Canadian national note loudly
vocal and inspiring. We catch it unmistakably in Sangster’s
<span class='it'>Brock</span>—a really noble hymn to the memory of a national
hero, who had ‘saved Canada’ for the Canadians, but a
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
hymn that much more expresses the deeply felt unity of
the Canadian people:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>We observe for the first time in Canadian poetry, the
consciously felt sentiment of national unity—the first express
utterance of the ideal of Canada and its people as a
political and spiritual entity apart—in Sangster’s line, ‘A
<span class='it'>nation’s</span> fealty is theirs.’ Henceforth we shall often hear
this distinction—Canada and its people as a <span class='it'>nation</span>—in
the verse of Canadian poets. Sangster, then, is important
as the poet who, in aesthetically and artistically respectable
verse, first uttered, <span class='it'>consciously</span> and clearly, in Canadian
nativistic poetry the people’s sense of a national spirit and
destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again: Sangster, in <span class='it'>The Rapid</span> and in <span class='it'>The Falls of
Chaudière</span>, is the first nativistic poet to express in verse
that close or intimate kinship with Nature which we discover
much more profoundly expressed in the poetry of
Roberts, Lampman, and Carman. Sangster utters this new
naturalistic note in these authentically inspired lines from
<span class='it'>The Falls of Chaudière</span>:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I have laid my cheek to Nature’s, placed my puny hand in hers,</p>
<p class='line0'>Felt a kindred spirit warming all the life-blood of my face.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>I have laid my cheek to Nature’s!</span> We shall observe
Lampman lay his cheek to Nature’s with more intimacy,
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
with a more profound sense of spiritual companionship
than Sangster. We shall note Carman ‘place his puny
hand’ in Nature’s—and have Nature as Mother April
‘make him over’—with a far more intimate giving of self
to the ‘heart of the world’ than Sangster. Nevertheless,
we must remark Sangster’s priority—in spirit as well as
in actual poetic production—in expressing that special and
singular kinship with Nature which must be denoted as
peculiarly Canadian. Still, in this respect, he is only the
first forerunner of Roberts, Lampman, Carman, Pauline
Johnson, Campbell, and Duncan Campbell Scott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A much more lyrically eloquent and influential forerunner
is Charles Mair. He was born at Lanark, Ontario,
in 1838, and published, in 1868, his <span class='it'>Dreamland and Other
Poems</span>. Technically, Charles Mair is a much finer craftsman
than Sangster; for the latter was self-educated,
whereas Mair was a university graduate who was well
read in the modern English poets and had studied the forms
of verse and the mechanics of versification. What, however,
really constitutes Mair as the authentic forerunner of
Roberts, Lampman, Carman and Pauline Johnson as nature
poets, is not the fact that he was an artistic poet of Nature
in Canada, but that his <span class='it'>method of treating Nature</span> was a
<span class='it'>new</span> method with Canadian poets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two ‘features’ mark and distinguish the treatment of
Nature in the poetry of Charles Mair—impressionistic
painting of the face of Nature and the choice of the commonplace
or the lowliest creatures in Nature as the subjects
of his poetry. The first may have been inspired by Keats,
and may be regarded as in the manner of Keats. But the
second feature of Mair’s lyrical poetry—his conscious attempt
to give distinction to the Commonplace in Nature in
Canada;—that is original with Mair himself, and appears
for the first time in Canadian poetry in Mair’s work. It
is <span class='it'>Canadian</span> in and by itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilfred Campbell has alleged that Mair influenced
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
Roberts and Lampman as Nature poets. All three were
influenced by Keats, and certainly Roberts and Lampman
knew the poetry of Keats more intimately than that of
Mair. At least, Mair in a sense did but anticipate Roberts
and Lampman in actually treating Canadian Nature. But
Mair’s treatment of the commonplace was objective—being
mostly a sort of philosophical or religious reflection on the
meaning of the commonplace, whereas Lampman’s treatment
of the same kind of subject was psychological. Mair
merely looked on and interrogated Nature, Lampman
communed with his lowly companions, such as the trees
and the frogs, entered into their hearts, and spoke out for
them, expressing their moods, feelings, and reflections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The passage from the objective treatment of Nature to
the subjective interpretation of the commonplace in Nature
by Canadian poets, has its <span class='it'>termini</span> marked by Mair at the
one end and Lampman at the other. Mair merely interrogates
and wonders what the answer ought to be to his
questions. Lampman communes with his lowly and animate
companions in Nature, and, by imaginative sympathy,
answers for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These distinctions between Mair as an impressionistic
Nature-<span class='it'>painter</span> and an objective <span class='it'>interrogator</span>, and Lampman
as a subjective interpreter of Nature, are nicely
illustrated in Mair’s exquisitely beautiful and sensuously
lovely poem, <span class='it'>The Fire-Flies</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE FIRST RENAISSANCE IN CANADIAN LITERATURE—THE
SYSTEMATIC SCHOOL AND PERIOD—ROBERTS AND HIS
COLLEAGUES.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>he</span> years 1860, 1861, and 1862 may be regarded as
the most significant in the literary history of Canada.
In the year 1860 were born Charles George Douglas Roberts
and Charles William Gordon (<span class='it'>pseud.</span>, Ralph Connor).
In the year 1861 were born William Bliss Carman, Archibald
Lampman, William Wilfred Campbell, E. Pauline
Johnson (<span class='it'>pseud.</span>, Tekahionwake), Margaret Marshall Saunders,
and Frederick George Scott. In the year 1862 were
born Duncan Campbell Scott and Gilbert (now Sir Gilbert)
Parker. The most gifted and eminent of Canadian poets
and imaginative or creative prose writers, these ten Canadians
comprised a single group, and they began, under the
influence of the awakening spirit of Canadian nationality,
the first systematic writing of poetry and prose, inaugurating
a period of original literary creation, which we shall
term, for expository purposes, the First Renaissance in
Canadian Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These ten writers were born, bred and educated (intellectually
and aesthetically) in the four Provinces—Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec—which
formed, on the proclamation of the British North America
Act, 1867, or shortly after the birth of this group of writers,
the Dominion of Canada. From the point of view of
their nativity and education the members of the literary
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
group born in 1860, 1861, and 1862, are the first strictly
so-called <span class='it'>Canadian</span> poets and prose writers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again: they were the first native-born poets and prose
writers to begin, under the Confederacy, a systematic
literary career. The term ‘systematic’ defines their conspectus
and aims. To this literary group the free and
impassioned expression, in verse and prose, of beauty and
truth, as beauty is in Nature in Canada and truth in Canadian
thought, activities, and institutions, appeared as their
own specific function and ideal life. They were thus the
first Canadians consciously to undertake a literary career
which should be, in its way and degree, commensurate with
the growing spiritual, social, political, and commercial life
of the Great Dominion, and to find their inspiration chiefly,
if not wholly, in the natural beauty and sublimity of their
homeland, and in the spiritual import of their country and
of the lives of their compatriots. In short, their literary
conspectus was thoroughly Canadian; and their inspiration
and ideals, too, were Canadian. In fact, their inspiration
and ideals were a moral necessity born of a loyal obedience
to the same creative impulse that was active in other
Canadians who also were bent on constructive achievement
in other spheres of Canadian endeavor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover: the literary group born in 1860, 1861, 1862,
may be distinguished as having been the first Canadian
poets and prose writers who, by actual performance, showed
the nations, largely the peoples of the Motherland and the
United States, that the political and commercially lusty
young Confederacy was, on its own account, decidedly
active in letters. The truth is that, in the decade following
1887, which witnessed the publication of the first work
in verse and in prose by the systematic group of Canadian
men and women of letters, Canadian poetry and imaginative
prose, though they were derivative in form and
frequently derivative in theme, quite gained the decent
regard, and, in some instances, the admiration, of distinguished
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
men of letters in England and in the United States,
and furnished a pledge of greater achievement in literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Canadian poets and prose writers born in 1860,
1861, and 1862, distinguish themselves and the years in
which they were born as the first systematically creative
School and Period in the literary history of Canada. Their
creative activities and their poetry and prose we have
denominated as the First Renaissance in Canadian
Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What is meant by the First Renaissance in Canadian
Literature? In 1880 a young native-born Canadian,
Charles G. D. Roberts, published a book of poems. The
critics of England and the United States thought well of
the verse. There was in it a quality that had not been in
previous books of verse by native-born Canadians. The
poems were marked by a certain noteworthy <span class='it'>artistic finish</span>
in the craftsmanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was significant. Hitherto native-born Canadian
poets had not been adroit in technique; they had been very
careless about it, and some of them had no respect or feeling
for it at all. Poetry was poetry, they thought, whether
it was well dressed or not. With the publication of his
<span class='it'>Orion</span>, Roberts sounded the death knell of slovenly or
indifferent technique in Canadian poetry. Working with
him, and largely under the influence of his ideal of technical
finish in verse, were Lampman, Carman, Campbell, Pauline
Johnson, Duncan Campbell Scott, Frederick George Scott,
and others. They all cared supremely for fine technique
in poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the second decade after 1887 there arose in Canada
a group of poets who were not solicitous about the technique
of their verse. With them fine artistry in Canadian verse
declined. This Decadent Interim lasted but a few years.
A later band of poets arose who went back to the ‘technical’
ideals which were exemplified in the poetry of Roberts
and his colleagues. This younger band of poets ‘restored’
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
the ideals of the first literary group and began the Restoration
Period in Canadian poetry. Collaterally, a similar
course of distinction, decadence, and restoration of technical
ideals can be observed in Canadian imaginative and
aesthetic prose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another sense the period which began with Roberts
and his <span class='it'>confrères</span> may properly be denoted as the First
Renaissance in Canadian Literature. It happens that the
best of the Pre-Confederation Literature, produced either
by <span class='it'>émigrés</span> or by native sons of the Province, was the work
of ‘old minds.’ Consider, for instance, the historical
romances of Major John Richardson and the satiric humor
of Thomas Chandler Haliburton, the poetry of Oliver
Goldsmith, 2nd, and of such <span class='it'>émigrés</span> as Charles Heavysege
and John Reade, the romantic poetic dramas of John
Hunter-Duvar and the prose tales of James De Mille. We
observe that, despite certain engaging novelty in themes
and treatment, it is all the work of old men; that is to say,
of minds which were attempting to ‘transplant’ old traditional
methods and the forms of a past literature in a soil
which was naturally hostile to their growth and gave them
a mean and dry exotic existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we fancy that we discover in the best Pre-Confederation
literature the fresh beauty and vitality of youth, we
shall discover, if we look critically, that this vitality and
beauty are the last hectic or pale flowering of an exotic
English literature, and that, commingled with the beauty,
are the wrinkles of sapless age. To be sure, there is
the flame of creative fire in, for example, Richardson and
Haliburton. Notwithstanding, it is the flame which flares
up, with a startling brilliancy, just before it dies out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, then, Pre-Confederation Canadian Literature
was essentially a transplanted Old World literature. Inevitably
it was alien to the soil of Canadian life, genius,
and ideals. It, therefore, lacks real vitality, vigor, and
truth. Except in Nova Scotia, in the time of Haliburton
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
and Howe, it was the outcome of personal, not necessary
social expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, after Confederation, expression of the spiritual
and social needs of the Great Dominion became a national
necessity. This expression, being born out of the spiritual
and social needs of Canada, must be considered, however
derivative the mere forms employed, as a genuine literary
Renaissance. The period or movement begun by the
systematic groups of poets and prose writers born in Canada
in 1860, 1861, and 1862 may, then, properly be denoted
as the First Renaissance in Canadian Literature.</p>

<h3>Charles G. D. Roberts</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>ROBERTS SPONSOR TO LAMPMAN—LITERARY FATHER OF
BLISS CARMAN—MASTER OF VERSE TECHNIQUE—FORMS OF
HIS VERSE, AND ITS QUALITIES.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span><span class='sc'>hether</span> Charles G. D. Roberts had a genuine
formative influence on Canadian literature, particularly
Canadian poetry, or whether he should be regarded
merely as ‘the eldest brother’ of the first systematic
group of Canadian poets and prose writers may, possibly,
be a moot question. Of a certainty he was the first native-born
Canadian to take the leading role in making real and
permanent, both by singular influences and by actual production
in poetry and imaginative prose, a native and
national literature in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First: Roberts was the literary <span class='it'>sponsor</span> of Archibald
Lampman. In 1884, while editor of <span class='it'>The Week</span>, Roberts
published in that periodical the very first poems which
Lampman contributed to the public press (<span class='it'>The Coming of
Winter</span>, and <span class='it'>Three-Flower Petals</span>). This is much more
significant than appears on first view. It must be remembered
that Roberts, though but twenty-four years old at
the time of his editorship, had already published, in 1880,
his <span class='it'>Orion and Other Poems</span>, which had been well received
by the critical press in England and the United States.
This distinction, abetted by his editorial connection with
Goldwin Smith, the founder of <span class='it'>The Week</span>, gave him some
of the glory of a new literary ‘star’ and made him an authority
whose good opinion of another’s verse was very inspiring
when it took the form of introducing a young unknown
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
native poet to the Canadian public. In 1884 Lampman was
a young man, human, sensitive, and shy. Roberts was
the first to recognize Lampman’s authentic genius and the
first to give him that practical encouragement which alone
counts constructively—a first and right start, <span class='it'>per aspera</span>
indeed, but, for Lampman, <span class='it'>ad astra</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roberts was also the ‘literary father’ of Bliss Carman.
In 1885 Roberts was appointed Professor of Literature at
King’s College, Windsor, Nova Scotia. It was Roberts
who really trained Bliss Carman in the poetic perception
of Nature and in poetic technique and who inspired him
to begin a poetic career. It all happened in this way: To
Roberts’ home, at Windsor, came Bliss Carman, a cousin
of the elder poet. Here Carman spent several of his growing,
most impressionable, and most receptive years, coming
directly under the pervasive influences—the aesthetic culture
and a tutorship in poetic technique—of the elder poet.
Further: with Windsor as a centre, and Roberts as a
companion and guide, Carman made excursions over the
lovely and glamorous scenes and haunts of beauty near
and beyond Roberts’ home. Carman, with Roberts, dwelt
and communed with Nature intimately, visited the hiding
places of earthly beauty, fed his senses with pure delight
of stream, lake and marsh, woodland and sky, tuned his
heart to hear, with peculiar meaning and joy, the cries of
the denizens of the woodland, the murmurings, dronings,
and shrillings of insects, and the dulcet lilting voices of
birds. Also, in fancy and peaceful reverie, Carman lived
over again all the rare moments and joys of sensation and
spiritual ecstasy experienced by him in that lovely area of
country conscribing Windsor, the land of Evangeline, the
Gaspereau valley, the Basin of Minas, and the Tantramar
marshes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the young Carman’s senses and imagination discovered
the beauty, glamor, and glory of land and sea.
Inevitably, at length, he was inspired to emulate the elder
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
poet, Roberts, and to begin the systematic writing of the
winning lyrism which, in the years that followed, has given
Carman a name <span class='it'>sui generis</span>, not only amongst the poets of
his homeland, Canada, but also amongst the poets of the
English-speaking races.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again: two years after taking up his residence at
Windsor, Roberts published his really epoch-making volume
of poetry, <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span> (1887). This was his second
volume of verse and, in it, his genius and art shone with
greater glory, especially in the eyes of the critics and poets
of the United States who were not likely to think, at any
rate in that day, that anything could come out of Canada,
particularly Nova Scotia, except pulpwood, coal, fish, and
potatoes. Roberts and his poetic work disillusioned the
young Canadian poet’s American cousins and taught them
that Canada produced mind, and even poetic genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roberts was related to Carman by blood and temperament
and poetic tutorship. These facts of various relationship
between Roberts and Carman became known in
the United States; and the light of Roberts’ literary reputation
was reflected on his cousin, Bliss Carman. It was,
therefore, natural that the editor of <span class='it'>The Atlantic Monthly</span>
should, as actually happened, publish in that magazine
Carman’s first significant poem, <span class='it'>Low Tide on Grand Pré</span>
(1887), which became the title poem of his first volume
of verse, <span class='it'>Low Tide on Grand Pré: a Book of Lyrics</span> (New
York, 1893). All this is more significant than it seems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a young poet, story-teller, or essayist to have his
work published in <span class='it'>The Atlantic Monthly</span> is a literary distinction
by itself. The imprimatur of <span class='it'>The Atlantic
Monthly</span> is as a royal seal in the kingdom of letters on the
American continent. Largely through the sponsorship of
Roberts’ reputation, Carman was favorably known to the
editor of <span class='it'>The Atlantic Monthly</span>. When, therefore, the
magazine published Carman’s first important poem, the
poet was properly and most significantly introduced to the
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
literary world. For <span class='it'>The Atlantic Monthly</span> enters only the
homes of the most cultured readers in the United States,
Canada, and the United Kingdom. The placing of its imprimatur
on the verse of Bliss Carman was a declaration to
the world that Canada had produced another new and engaging
poet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more: at least in one matter Roberts had a considerable
influence on several of the other members of the
first systematic group of Canadian poets. He was the
first native-born Canadian poet to be solicitous about poetic
technique, and had thus won the notice and even commendation
of critics and poets in England and the United States.
In his <span class='it'>Orion</span> and in his <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span> Roberts held up
the ideal of finished technique in poetry. Roberts’ success
from 1880 to 1887 became, therefore, an inspiration to
other poets in the first systematic group, and inspired them
to accomplish a body of verse excellent enough, at least in
technique, for publication in volume form without danger
of discrediting themselves and their country. So, in fact,
it happened: Lampman and Scott (F. G.) published their
first volume of verse in 1888; Campbell his first in 1889;
Carman his first in 1893: Scott (D. C.) his first in 1893;
Pauline Johnson her first in 1895.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still further: it was Roberts’ two volumes of verse
that first called the attention of the literary public in the
United States and in England to the fact that <span class='it'>systematic</span>
literary activity was going on in Canada, and that first
awakened critical curiosity about the new Canadian poets
and their verse whenever a volume by Roberts or any
of his poetic compatriots was published. Roberts’ renown
obtained for the others a ready and just ‘hearing.’ This
achieved, the quality of their verse, especially of their
nature-poetry, brought them, it is fair to say, very favorable
appreciation from the critics and poets of the United
States and England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally: Roberts is related to the first systematic group
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
of Canadian poets and prose writers, not only pragmatically
as sponsor, inspirer, and leader: but also in a special way.
He was the ‘Voice’ of the Canadian Confederacy. Seven
years after the publication of his <span class='it'>Orion</span>, suddenly the
Canadian people heard Roberts trumpeting a new song.
In it there was nothing classical in theme, and nothing cold
and correctly formal in artistic structure and finish. Roberts
had changed from an Artist to a Prophet, from an
Artificer in verse to a Voice—the Voice of one crying in
the wilderness and trying to make straight the paths of
the Canadian people. He was still a young man but he
had been vouchsafed vision and he called magniloquently
to his compatriots, thus:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>O Child of Nations, giant-limbed,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Who stand’st among the nations now</p>
<p class='line0'>Unheeded, unadorned, unhymned,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With unanointed brow,—</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>How long the ignoble sloth, how long</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The trust in greatness not thine own?</p>
<p class='line0'>Surely the lion’s brood is strong</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To front the world alone!</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He repeated his trumpeting to the Canadian to awake
to a national consciousness of destiny and to achieve that
destiny—he repeated the ‘call’ in language even more magniloquent—in
his <span class='it'>Ode to the Canadian Confederacy</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps these were only ‘occasional’ poems, artificially
inspired. At any rate Roberts’ Vision of Canadian nationality
and his interest in expressing it forsook him. A few
years after uttering the ‘Call’ he left his native Canadian
habitat (in 1895) for New York. Yet in the fifteen years
from 1880 to 1895 in the homeland, or till his removing
to New York, by his own fine artistry and by the influence,
at least of his example, on his contemporaries in Canada,
Roberts was considerably, perhaps chiefly, potent in raising
native Canadian poetry to a degree of technical finish that
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
was never before reached or even attempted by native-born
Canadian men and women of letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Summarily: as discoverer and sponsor of Lampman, as
inspirer and sponsor of Carman, and as exemplar, at least
in technical ideals, to the first native-born group of systematic
poets of the Dominion, Charles G. D. Roberts wielded
a constructive influence on Canadian native and national poetry.
That without his influence there would still have been a
Systematic School of Canadian Poets, of which Lampman,
Carman, or D. C. Scott might have been the most
conspicuous creator, is a high probability. But it is a
theoretical probability. We cannot, however, gainsay the
fact of Roberts’ constructive influence on his <span class='it'>confrères</span> in
the Systematic School of Canadian Poets. On the grounds,
therefore, of his triple role as sponsor, inspirer, and exemplar,
and of his own creative poetic art, Charles G. D.
Roberts is justly to be distinguished as the Inaugurator of
the First Renaissance in Canadian Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roberts’ own poetry may be critically appreciated (1)
as a recrudescence of the English classical idyll; (2) as
poetry of nature, with special reference to its distinction
from the nature-poetry of Lampman; (3) as elegiac
poetry; and (4) as poetry of modern eroticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the outset it is important to emphasize two singular
facts. First, with the single notable exception of Roberts’
spasmodic ‘Call’ to the Canadian people to achieve a national
destiny, and with the further exception of a national or
Canadian setting and color in some of his nature-poetry,
Roberts’ verse is anything but Canadian. Secondly,
Roberts’ poetry is signally an example of poetry which is
not, to use Mathew Arnold’s formula, ‘a profound and
beautiful application of ideas to life.’ It is characteristic
of the essential Canadian genius that its attitudes to the
universe and to existence are moral and religious, that it
values the fine arts, including literature, as a means for the
ideal enhancement of life, and loves the Beautiful in the
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
fine arts as the only visible instance of the union of the
real and of the ideal, which is, philosophically viewed, our
only pledge of the ultimate supremacy of the Good. The
only really deadly criticism, therefore, that can be applied
against the poetry of Roberts is that he has missed in his
own verse the supreme ethical note or ideal which is in
the poetry of one of his masters, Keats:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Beauty is truth, truth beauty,</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and that he did not engage himself to write poetry, with
the intent which was really the aim of Keats, as well as of
Arnold, namely, as a profound and beautiful application of
ideas to life. Aware now of the unethical intent and
quality of Robert’s poetry, we can the better and more
justly appreciate his development as a poet and his
achievements in poetic substance and technique.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was natural and inevitable that an undergraduate
introduced, at College, into the world of letters through the
poetry of the Greek and Latin classics and the highly lyrical
and sensuous poetry of Shelley, Keats, and Tennyson,
should, when he himself felt impelled to write, produce
poetry which, in substance and style, was based on classical
themes, and colored with sensuous images, and that, when
critically estimated, this poetry should be valued as a sincere
but finished academic exercise in verse. Roberts’ first
volume, <span class='it'>Orion and Other Poems</span>, was just such an academic
exercise in verse. Yet it was an exercise by a lad just out
of college who not only informed his verse with a respectable
showing of classical scholarship and with an engaging
Arcadian setting and color but also wrote with so careful
a technique that when his verse was compared with that of
earlier Canadian poets, it was found to be unprovincial
in scope and appeal, and more finished in technique than
any previous Canadian verse. It was indeed derivative,
literary, academic. It was vitiated with youthful crudities
in thought and manner and certain borrowings. But, on
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
the whole, it was as excellent a first book of verse as might
be issued by any young Oxford or Cambridge undergraduate
or, conceivably, by Shelley, Tennyson, or Swinburne in
their undergraduate days. Indeed, critics and poets in
England and in the United States, in reviewing <span class='it'>Orion and
Other Poems</span>, noted the volume as a respectable performance
in verse and a fair promise of excellent future poetry
from the Dominion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roberts’ first volume <span class='it'>Orion and Other Poems</span> is a significant
disclosure, both positively and negatively, of his
essential genius and art. Positively, the bias or bend of
his genius was towards English neo-classical idyllism and
sensuous impressionism. Negatively, his genius lacked, and
has continued to lack, original imagination or imaginative
power. In his first volume, his ‘properties,’ to use a term
borrowed from the stage and employed by Robert Bridges,
Poet Laureate, are the same ‘properties’ as appear in the
Keatsian idyll. In Roberts’ earliest verse masquerade
mythical Greek deities and heroes, sylvan demi-gods and
demi-goddesses, Arcadian denizens and shepherds, painted
with rich sensuous color against a background of pastoral
or idyllic landscape, to the accompaniment of impressionistic
verbal music; alliteration, consonance, assonance, and
vowel-harmony. All this is a recrudescence, unmistakably,
of the same qualities in Keats, Tennyson, and Swinburne.
In short, Roberts appears as an unoriginal or unimaginative
nature-and-figure-painter and verbal melodist. A single
example from <span class='it'>Orion</span> will suffice:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For there the deep-eyed night</p>
<p class='line0'>Looked down on me; unflagging voices called</p>
<p class='line0'>From unpent waters falling; tireless wings</p>
<p class='line0'>From long winds bear me tongueless messages</p>
<p class='line0'>From star-consulting, silent pinnacles;</p>
<p class='line0'>And breadth, and depth, and stillness</p>
<p class='line0'>Fathered me.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>In that passage criticism at once notes that Roberts,
as a very young poet, begins his professional career as a
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
clever ‘word virtuoso.’ That passage certainly suggests, as
no doubt it imitates, the sensuous impressionism of the
Choric Song in Tennyson’s <span class='it'>Lotus Eaters</span>. Its verbal
music carries the same kind of vague impressionism which
we hear in the gossamer tone-painting of Debussy’s orchestral
prelude <span class='it'>L’Après-midi d’un Faune</span>. No one will
doubt the sincere ambition of Roberts to be a poet, and
the sincerity of his choice of themes and properties, diction,
and poetic style. Yet, while noting the artificiality of it
all, one does wonder that a tyro poet could, in a first volume
of undergraduate verse, so consummately simulate, as
Roberts did, the art of the supreme masters of English
neo-classical idyllism and impressionism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As yet, then, Roberts’ poetry discloses only talent in
him, nothing of genius, or originality, or imagination. His
poetry is, after all, a cleverly sublimated academic exercise.
Literary psychologists cannot escape the feeling that Roberts
deliberately ‘manufactured’ his first volume of verse—cannot
help picturing the young poet diligently figuring
away in his student’s cloister at the properties, forms and
metres of his imitative idyllism and impressionism. It is
all Artifice; all artificial. As yet in Roberts’ verse there
is no ‘note’ of inspiration awakened by the magic and mystery
of the great Dominion—no New World ‘note’ caught
from Canadian Nature, or from Canadian romantic life
and contemporary civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his second volume of poems, <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span>, there
is an advance in variety of inspiration, in his forms and
metres, and in finish of technique. Still, on the whole, the
themes and properties, rhythms, metres, and color are those
of English neo-classical idyllism and impressionism. There
is, however, some suggestion of a change away from his
former too imitative adherence to the subject, manner, and
style of the English idyllists. There is, for instance, a
suggestion of a structural, but not ethical, influence from
Browning. There is, in this regard, a Browningesque coinage
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
of unconventional or awkward diction, an adoption of
a Browningesque metre and an introduction of ‘medley’ as
when he inserts, after the Browning manner, a lyrical
interlude, unexpectedly and with no logical justification,
into the text of a broader, more serious movement and more
ethically informed subject. His second volume of poetry,
<span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span>, shows that Roberts has talent, but is still
unimaginative and artificial. Yet his second volume is
much more significant than his first, not by its being more
various in its themes and forms, but by its exhibiting new
tendencies in the bent of the poet’s mind and imagination.
There is a tendency towards ethical influences and to get
away from his early preoccupation with English neo-classical
idyllism and impressionism. There is also the
merest show of a tendency to occupy his imagination with
ideas of the Canadian ‘spirit’ and the beauty and wonder of
Nature in Canada. There is, however, no distinctive embodiment
of inspirational ideas or moods awakened by the
Great Dominion or the New World.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding, in his second volume Roberts is
taking his first step on the way to the expression of
the essential form and manner of his creative genius
as a poet. He was born to lilt, in simple lyrical
and descriptive verse, the aesthetic sensations and the
emotional nuances of Canadian life and external nature.
In short, Roberts was born to become, as he did become,
the most engaging and artistic, though not the first, native-born
Canadian idyllist. <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span> he first appears
as a really significant creative Canadian poet. But whenever,
in his later literary career, Roberts forsakes his light
or simple idyllic and impressionistic treatment of Canadian
life and external nature, as he forsakes it in the monody,
in his poetry of city life, and in his poetry of modern
eroticism, he may be engaging or arresting or impressive,
but in nowise is he creatively significant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same volume, <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span>, Roberts exhibits
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
two manners. In some poems in the volume he clings to
his old manner of English Classical Impressionism. In
other poems in the same volume he essays his new manner
of Canadian Impressionism. The first is distinguished by
overweighted sensuousness, by over-burdened luxurious
color of descriptive epithet and verbal music. An impressive
example is <span class='it'>Off Pelorus</span>, the sensuous quality of which may
be suggested by the following single stanza:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Idly took we thought, for still our eyes betray us,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Lo, the white-limbed maids, with love-soft eyes aglow,</p>
<p class='line0'>Gleaming bosoms bare, loosed hair, sweet hands to slay us,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Warm lips wild with song, and softer throat than snow!</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Roberts’ strictly Canadian Impressionism is colorful
and musical, but the structure of the verse is simple, as,
for instance, <span class='it'>On the Creek</span>, an idyllic lyric, full of Canadian
color, and highly alliterative, beginning:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Dear heart, the noisy strife,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And bitter harpings cease.</p>
<p class='line0'>Here is the lamp of life,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Here are the lips of peace.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Roberts developed other ‘manners’ or styles. But, unquestionably,
this Canadian idyllic impressionism, simple
in thought and form, yet colorful and musical, is his
natural <span class='it'>forte</span>—his <span class='it'>natural, characteristic manner</span>. It is
exemplified, in the same volume, by other Canadian idylls
in the simple style of <span class='it'>On the Creek</span>, as, for instance, <span class='it'>In The
Afternoon</span>, <span class='it'>Salt</span>, <span class='it'>Winter Geraniums</span>, <span class='it'>Birch and Paddle</span>;
by distinct and deliberate suffusions of Canadian Nature in
dactylic hexameters, as in <span class='it'>The Tantramar Revisited</span>, and
in the sonnet-form (somewhat anticipating the nature-poetry
of Lampman), as in Roberts’ genuinely noble sonnets
<span class='it'>The Sower</span>, and <span class='it'>The Potato Harvest</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We may turn now to a general consideration of Roberts’
poetic treatment of Nature. In Roberts’ first volume,
in his strictly Arcadian poetry, there is nothing of Canadian
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
Nature, nothing of Canadian scenery, nor the color and
sentiment of Canadian life in the habitat of the distinctive
Canadian spirit. In the second volume, <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span>,
there is a definitive engagement, on his part, with Canadian
Nature, or with Canadian life and sentiment pictured
against Canadian backgrounds; and also a change in the
form and style of Roberts’ poetic composition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natural forms of Roberts’ art are light, simple,
lyrical, and descriptive verse, which he treats with charming
naturalness, almost <span class='it'>naiveté</span>, with simple tunefulness of
ballad or folk rhythms, and which sometimes he delicately
suffuses with a contemplative revery, a gentle melancholy,
or a subdued sentimental reflection on the magic and mystery
of Nature and life, somewhat in the manner of Herrick
and Tennyson, and Longfellow. But Roberts’ lyrical
idyllism or nature-description is not always wholly soft or
sentimental, pretty, or gentle, or charming, nor is his new
manner always in folk rhythm in form. At times, even
when simple, his verse is picturesque, even brusque, vigorous,
and overweighted with descriptive details as if, in the
last matter, he must ‘paint in’ all the features and properties
of Canadian Nature and leave nothing of its physiognomy
to be added by the imagination of the reader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roberts, however, has one singular limitation, an innate
defect of his genius. He cannot limn the human person
or figure as one of the properties of his poetry of Canadian
woodlands or pastoral scenery and life. In the matter of
human portraiture against a background of Nature Roberts,
as poet, is abstract and faltering in drawing, lifeless, unveracious,
ineffective. Otherwise in the Canadian idyll or
in nature-description he is concrete, veracious, simple but
graphic, nearly always winningly musical and on the whole
satisfying. In short, Roberts discloses in his new manner,
in the Canadian idyll and his Acadian nature-poetry, the
sure possession of the secrets of color, movement and
music, and of real Canadian national sentiment, in the
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
presence of life and nature. He is an adroit nature-colorist
and verbal melodist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Absent, however, from his genius and art are all gifts
in spiritual portraiture and the fine and noble interpretation
of Nature which Lampman discloses in his nature-poetry
and his interpretation of the essential Canadian spirit from
the embodiment of that spirit, as Lampman discerns it, in
Nature in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roberts’ treatment of Nature may be illustrated by
examples taken from his second volume, <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span>
(1887), and from <span class='it'>The Book of the Native</span> (1896), in the
latter of which are some poems that really belong, in form,
and spirit, to the time when he was changing his abstract
<span class='it'>Arcadian</span> manner to his concrete <span class='it'>Acadian</span> manner as in
his <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span>. Illustrative of Roberts’ change to a
Canadian theme and to the modern simple method of
treating Nature, in the pseudo-classical style, an apt example
is <span class='it'>The Tantramar Revisited</span>, composed in the dactylic
hexameter, a form, suggested, no doubt, by Longfellow’s
pretty story of Evangeline. In this poem Roberts treats
Canadian Nature with an impressive originality in properties,
color, and sentiment, and certainly with a pervasive
directness and veracity which prove his sincerity and which
convince the reader that the poet was moved by the beauty
and pathos of his Acadian subject:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ah, the old-time stir, how once it stung me with rapture,—</p>
<p class='line0'>Old-time sweetness, the winds freighted with honey and salt!</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet will I stay my steps and not go down to the marshland,—</p>
<p class='line0'>Muse and recall far off, rather remember than see,—</p>
<p class='line0'>Lest on too close sight I miss the darling illusion,</p>
<p class='line0'>Spy at their task even here the hands of chance and change.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>What a change in Roberts—this change from the abstract,
artificial, academic, over-sensuous treatment of
Nature in Arcadia to his direct, simple, concrete treatment
of real nature in Acadia, with his poet’s eyes directly ‘on
the object.’ There we have the real, the genuine Roberts,
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
the original authentic poet of Canadian Nature and life
and nationality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an example of his colored realism or idyllic naturalism
tinged with a sort of Wordsworthian plainness or
austerity of style and ethical revery, consider his sonnet
<span class='it'>The Sower</span>. It has been called Roberts’ ‘popular masterpiece.’
As a sonnet, it is perfect in artistic structure, and
is as faithful to Canadian Nature and sentiment as, say,
Millet’s paintings, <span class='it'>The Reapers</span> and <span class='it'>The Angelus</span>, are true
to French pastoral life and religious sentiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this sonnet is a good example of Roberts’ ineffectiveness
in human or spiritual portraiture. How effectively
it pictures for us the land, the sky, the birds, the
human properties of the Acadian landscape in Nova Scotia.
The poem visualizes vividly for us all the features and elements
of external Nature; yet it fails to visualize the Sower
<span class='it'>himself</span>, to limn him effectively, graphically, impressively
against the background of Nature as, on the other hand,
Millet has graphically limned the human figures in his
paintings against the French landscape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally: a poem which is a really fine example of Roberts’
characteristic genius and art in the authentic Canadian
idyll and in nature-description, and which, perhaps, contains
his nearest approach to graphic figure-poetry, namely, his
lyric <span class='it'>The Solitary Woodsman</span>, is specially noteworthy.
Though published in <span class='it'>The Book of the Native</span>, it really belongs
to the period of <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span> when Roberts was
changing over to his natural and characteristic manner of
Canadian idyllic impressionism. For it is a gentle, natural,
and simple lyrical idyll of Canadian Nature and life, tinged
with a delicate mood of contemplation and pathos. A
touch more of ‘personal detail,’ of moral characterization,
would have made <span class='it'>The Solitary Woodsman</span> as universal and
popular a portrait as the genre picture of the hardy, happy
village blacksmith in Longfellow’s poem with that subject.
Nevertheless, the poem has vigor, action, life-likeness; it is
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
veracious and picturesque. In it Roberts is at his best in
the Canadian lyrical idyll and in figure-portraiture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strict analysis of Roberts’ nature-poetry reveals both
the positive qualities and the defects of his genius and
art. As a poet of Nature in Acadia he hardly more than
effects <span class='it'>glimpses</span> of Canadian scenery and pastoral life,
colorful, no doubt, and tinged with a homely or even
tender naturalistic sentiment. His pictures of Canadian
scenery and pastoral life are indeterminate <span class='it'>pastels</span> of the
general features of Nature in Canada rather than rich,
broad paintings done with the forthright, broad brush-work
of a master artist. It is all pretty, or charming, and faithful
to Nature in Acadia. But it is all based on superficial
observation and is devoid of poetic, that is to say, profound
and beautiful application of ideas to life. It is not to be
expected that the Canadian people will treasure these
pastels of Canadian scenery and pastoral life. For though
they be beautiful, simple, and realistic, the ethical element
in them is always a reflection, a moral platitude, from the
poet’s own moralizing, or a recrudescence of some older
poets’ moralizings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The public is quick to detect insincerity in a poet.
While it would not be just to accuse Roberts of insincerity
whenever he attempts to moralize in his nature-poetry, or
to give it a moral or religious significance, it is still true
that Roberts’ nature-poetry is too superficial, too obviously
‘an effort’ to make pretty or charming pastels of Canadian
scenery and pastoral life, too lacking in thoroughly humanized
treatment of Nature, to be popular or cherished for
its own sake by the Canadian people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His pure lyrical pastels, as for instance, <span class='it'>On the Creek</span>,
and <span class='it'>The Solitary Woodsman</span>, are more likely to remain
permanently popular than are his Nature poems in other
forms, as, for example, the genuinely important sonnet-sequence
in his <span class='it'>Songs of the Common Day</span> (1893). In
these sonnets, however, he shows no increase of descriptive
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
power but only the variety of his word-painter’s palette.
Moreover, in these sonnets there is a felt insincerity of
aim. Though fine in structure, faithful to Canadian Nature,
variously treating the aspects of Canadian Nature, and
often sentimental and moralistic, they impress the reader
as having been designed and written deliberately to show
forth the poet’s powers in realistic or naturalistic impressionism,
in the philosophical interpretation of Nature, and
in technical artistry. Notwithstanding, it must be admitted
that in these sonnets Roberts, as an impressionistic painter
of Canadian Nature, is a master, and has his analogues, in
the pictorial painting of Nature, in Corot and Millet, and in
the tonal painting of Nature, in MacDowell and Debussy.
These sonnets were consciously designed to be
‘works of art,’ and to impress the philosophically minded
poets and critics of poetic form. Fine and masterful as
they are in technical artistry, and impressive, too, with a
resurgence of moral ideas, nevertheless they appeal neither
to the popular heart nor to the philosophical imagination.
For they create in the heart of the reader the sense only of
a splendid achievement in poetic artistry, but never any
sense of the poet’s own enrichment of life from his interpretation
of beauty in Canadian Nature, civilization, and
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Summarily: as an original Poet, Roberts’ <span class='it'>forte</span> is the
treatment of Canadian Nature and pastoral life in impressionistic
pastels, to an accompaniment of verbal music
in folk rhythms or simple lyric forms. Thus accepted and
appreciated he is a satisfying nature-colorist and melodist.
But, impressive and magnificent, as he is, in more formal or
larger poetic genres, as for instance, the sonnet and monody,
he fails to give us in both a vital application of ideas to
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Consideration of Roberts’ poetry of modern eroticism
reveals only what has been called a variety of Roberts’
‘ethical heterogeneity.’ This, however, is a defect in the
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
man rather than in the poet, and only negatively affects
Roberts’ significance in the literary history of Canada.
Roberts’ work as a threnodist, romantic novelist, and inventor
of a species of animal psychology in the romance
is considered elsewhere. It is, however, as the inaugurator
of the First Renaissance in Canadian Literature, both
poetry and prose, rather than as a poet of Canadian Nationality
and Nature, that Roberts has a right to a supremely
significant status in the literary history of Canada.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>n</span> 1887 Charles G. D. Roberts had, with his poem beginning
‘O Child of Nations’ and again with his magniloquent
<span class='it'>Ode to the Canadian Confederacy</span>, issued a ‘call’
to the Canadian people to realize a national consciousness
and to achieve a national destiny. He appeared as the ‘Voice’
of Canada. But he was a mere ‘Voice.’ For aside from
simply uttering the ‘call’ he did nothing else to awaken in
the Canadian people a consciousness of their own native
or national spirit and a love of country, except to publish
some impressionistic word pictures of Canadian scenery
and pastoral life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Swinburne had told the world that out of
Canada or Australia would come a great New Voice of
the Anglo-Saxon peoples. In 1889, or two years after
Roberts had trumpeted his ‘call’ to Canadians, Theodore
Watts-Dunton, poet, novelist, and the most far-visioned of
British critics then living, in an article on Canadian poetry
made the same prophecy as had Swinburne. ‘Canada,’ he
said, ‘had excellent poets, and with the development of a
national consciousness of the history, resources and wealth
of the country, would produce great poets.’ In 1918, or
practically thirty years after the prophecies of Swinburne
and Watts-Dunton and the ‘call’ of Roberts, Sir Herbert
Warren, President of Magdalen College, Oxford, and Professor
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
of Poetry at Oxford, in an address on ‘Overseas
Poetry,’ as he called it, before the Royal Colonial Institute,
London, also confessed to a vision of great poets arising in
Canada and said that, in his view, so far Canada had produced
only ‘some <span class='it'>good</span> poets.’ It is probable that the
prophecies of Swinburne and Watts-Dunton were merely
generous pleasantries or, possibly, ‘guesses at the truth.’
In any case what they were really concerned about was the
appearance of a great <span class='it'>Imperial</span> poet in Canada or some
other one of the British Overseas Dominions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Canadians themselves should be concerned about
is not whether Canada has produced a significant Imperial
poet but whether the Dominion has produced a signally
excellent poet who, if not the prophetic Voice of the Dominion,
is the true <span class='it'>Interpreter</span> of the essential Canadian
spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Sir Herbert Warren declared that Canada had
produced only some good poets, he had in mind Roberts,
Carman, Pauline Johnson, Valancy Crawford, W. H.
Drummond, and Robert Service. But the greatest poet
that Canada has produced, greatest as a nature-poet, and
as an interpreter of the essential mind and heart of the
Canadian people and country, is Archibald Lampman.
If Lampman is not great in the sense that Shelley or Keats
or Wordsworth or Tennyson or Browning or Swinburne
is great, at least he is more than a good poet. He is
a consummate artist. But more important, he is a subtle
interpreter of the Canadian national spirit by way of a
new and philosophical interpretation of Nature in Canada.
He is <span class='it'>par excellence</span> the poet of Canadian Nature and
Nationality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For inductive proof of ‘nationality’ in literature, consider
critically, and at some length, from Lampman’s
poetry, an impressive example of wholly indigenous expression
of the Canadian genius and the Canadian view of
Nature and of Life. Justly it may be held that this example
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
of interpretative nature-poetry by Lampman, which
goes under the name of <span class='it'>Sapphics</span>, is, for faultless technic,
for spiritual vision of Nature and for the beautiful application
of noble ideas to life, an indubitable contribution
to poetic art, and is peculiarly Canadian. This is not too
high praise; for the poem itself, with analyses of its form
and beauty, together with a commentary on its spiritual
meaning, will furnish sufficient evidence that it must be
given a unique place in Canadian Literature. For easy
expository purposes the poem may be divided into three
parts, which contain its three themes and their inspiration:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pure beauty of that poem, of its spiritual imagery,
of its rhythmic flow and cadences, <span class='it'>andante tranquillo</span>, and
the noble mood and emotion it induces—how it all affects
the heart and imagination like music heard in dim cathedral
aisles, or recalls us from the vulgar distractions of life
to sequestered retreats in the Canadian wildwood, there to
contemplate existence with a subdued joy and tender peace!
Nay more, we rise from communing with the poet, as he
did from his communion with Nature, anointed with a new
spiritual grace and with a new strength to achieve, amidst
ten thousand vicissitudes of fortune, a right worthy destiny—‘grandly
ungrieving.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each of the three parts of the poem has its own theme
and inspiration. The first section gives us the poet’s vision
of Nature and of Nature’s own (as well as the poet’s)
autumnal mood. This is an important distinction. It
distinguishes a peculiar Canadian pictorializing and humanizing
vision of Nature. Who can mistake in what land
comes that autumn, ‘clothed in a splendor,’ and ‘beautifully
sad and silent,’ in what land flourish those woods, ‘golden,
rose-red,’ and in what land rise those hills, ‘full of divine
remembrance’? Those are indisputably, unmistakably,
Canadian woods and hills, in their precise autumnal garb
and mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some would contend that this way of pictorializing Nature
is Grecian or even English. Rather is it peculiarly
Canadian. It is so for this reason: The Greeks, as it were,
‘decked out’ Nature solely for the sensuous enjoyment of a
world made lovely to look upon or pleasant to dwell in.
The external beauty of Nature was with them, as with
Keats and Wordsworth, when these two did not assume
the moralizing attitude, the sufficient reason for their impressionistic
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
word-painting. With Lampman, as with the
Kelts (and Lampman was a Gael on his mother’s side),
the physical loveliness of the face and garb of Nature is
an essential, living aspect of earth. For does not Nature
herself, as if conscious and reflective, change her aspect
and garb becomingly with her seasons and moods? Lampman’s
attitude to Nature is not the attitude of an impressionistic
landscape painter, but of one for whom physical
loveliness is supremely a spiritual revealment. This, however,
might be wholly Keltic, and not Canadian. But it is
Canadian, and not Keltic, because the interior revealment
expresses a special view of Nature and a special mode of
intimate communion between the Canadian heart and the
spirit of Nature in Canadian woods and streams and hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Part second of the poem gives us an altogether novel
and original spiritual interpretation of Nature’s mood and
temper. It is a mood or temper, be it remarked, not expressed
by Nature in any land save Canada, and not to be
divined, and sympathized with, by any other racial genius
save by the mind and heart indigenous to Canada, sensitive
emotionally to the varying aspects and manner of Nature
in Canada, as children to the meaning of changes in the
facial expression and manner of a mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The uncritical, having in mind that inveterate sermonizer
Wordsworth, may think that Lampman in this poem
does but ‘moralize’ Nature. Far from it, Lampman
‘humanizes’ Nature in a peculiar way, namely, by reciprocal
sympathy. We must mark that—‘reciprocal sympathy’—as
an original Canadian contribution to the poetic interpretation,
the spiritual revealment, of Nature. Lampman,
as he says himself, is ‘brother’ to Nature. Her
reflections on her own vicissitudes are as his own on his
fortunes of life. The Poet and Nature, though two
physically, are one by mutual bonds of sympathy. The
poet sympathizes with Nature as he himself feels that she
sympathizes with him. Thus does he humanize, not sentimentally,
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
but nobly, the Canadian maples and birches,
which, as he says:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Dream, sad-limbed, beholding their pomp and treasure</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Ruthlessly scattered:</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yet they quail not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>‘Yet they quail not’—there we have envisaged the mood
and temper of Canadian Nature! The Gael, visioning the
maples and birches, with his racial melancholy sentiment
for glories departed, might say of them that they
‘dream, sad-limbed.’ But only a Canadian, or a Canadian
Gael, apprehending, through sympathy, their inmost mood,
could say of them, nobly, inimitably: ‘Yet they quail not.’
And so Lampman, divining, with a more than Keltic
subtlety of vision, the spirit of the Canadian woods in
autumn, sympathetically responds to their mood, and is
heartened to endure, as they do, ‘silent and uncomplaining.’</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yet I will keep my spirit</p>
<p class='line0'>Clear and valiant, brother to these my noble</p>
<p class='line0'>Elms and maples, utterly grave and fearless,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Grandly ungrieving.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>‘Yet I will keep my spirit clear and valiant!’—Mark
that as the authentic <span class='it'>spiritual</span> note of the Canadian genius.
It is not Canadian, however, merely because it is the expression
of indomitable courage and serenity, but because
the idea, the inspiration, of a self-controlled destiny,
achieved with clearness of vision and valiant heart, first
comes to the mind and heart and moral imagination of the
Canadian poet <span class='it'>as a gift from Canadian woods</span>. He, for
his part, conveys that gift to his compatriots, by his poetic
envisagement of the ‘brotherhood’ of Man and Nature in
this land of glowing birches, noble elms and maples. That
‘note’ of clear-visioned faith and courage and serenity is
in Canadian poetry of earlier days, long before the Confederacy,
as well as in these days of social and commercial
progress. It was in the poetry of Sangster and Mair in
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
Ontario, and in the Gaelic verses of James MacGregor in
Nova Scotia. But it is most articulate and vocal in the
poetry of Archibald Lampman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considering now the first two parts of Lampman’s
poem as a whole, we become aware that the first distinctively
‘national’ note in the literature of the Canadian Confederacy
is a unique humanizing of Nature, singularly apparent
in the Nature-poetry of Lampman—a sympathetic
identity of mood and temper, a reciprocal sense of
brotherhood, between Man and Nature. This is a psychological
phenomenon by itself, belonging solely to the
Canadian genius and expressing itself, with fine art, solely
in Canadian poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like other poets, British and American, Canadian poets
have notable pictorializing gifts, and can visualize a scene
so vividly as to give a reader of their verse the intimate
view of an eye-witness of the reality. They can, as aptly
as Wordsworth, also moralize Nature and convey a noble
preachment. But of them all Lampman stands alone in
this—<span class='it'>the power to humanize Nature into personality, and
sympathetically identify her spirit with his own, in mood
and will</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lampman also stands alone in this—<span class='it'>in his love of local
beauty and his power to individualize and vitalize it</span>. This,
too, is a ‘national’ note and a psychological phenomenon
by itself. His is not a love of Nature’s beauty abstracted
from a particular time and place, but of those very scenes
and haunts where first he beheld Nature in all her physical
loveliness and many moods and became her intimate companion
and lover. Lampman so individualizes and vitalizes
his fields and woods, as Campbell his lakes, Roberts his
woods and marshes, and Carman his tide and mists and
April morns, that the reader can localize the region, and
‘time’ the season, of their inspiration with the nicest perception.
So singularly is this quality present, most notably in
poetry of Lampman, though also in the poetry of Roberts,
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
Carman, Campbell, Duncan Campbell Scott and Pauline
Johnson, that a reader can, with absolute surety, say not
only, ‘This is Canadian nature-beauty,’ but also, ‘This is
Canadian nature-beauty in Nova Scotia, in New Brunswick,
in Ontario.’ Surely, then, this peculiar imaginative interpretation
of Canadian Nature whereby Lampman and his
<span class='it'>confrères</span>, first, localize Nature, and, next, humanize her
noblest mood and temper into an identity with their own
is a supreme expression of the national spirit and raises
Post-Confederation poetry to the dignity of authentic
literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canadians are, in the eyes of the older nations, a notably
sane and happy people. They are so because they keep
their souls, in the phrase of Lampman, always ‘clear and
valiant,’ having, as Lampman, and even as Roberts and the
other poets of the First Renaissance in Canadian Literature,
a sure vision of the greatness of their country’s destiny
and of the means to it. The peculiar moral qualities
of the Canadian people are an inviolable faith in themselves,
an indomitable courage, and an imperturbable serenity.
The ground and inspiration of these qualities are in Canadian
woods and hills and waters, and Archibald Lampman,
in his nature-poetry, interprets these qualities of the Canadian
people and country with sweet reasonableness and
genuine nobility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In two of his finest sonnets, rich both in aesthetic and
in spiritual beauty, and worthy both of Keats and Wordsworth,
possibly suggesting the spirit of their finest sonnets,
Lampman has summarized his poetic and philosophical
creed. So beautiful in structure and imagery, so noble in
their expression of the courage and serenity and faith which
obtain in his <span class='it'>Sapphics</span>, and yet so wistful of the heavenly
beauty and so infused with the pathos of life are these
sonnets, that they move the soul and subdue the spirit with
‘thoughts too deep for tears.’ If there is any genuine meaning
to Arnold’s conception of the moral dignity and spiritual
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
function of poetry as ‘the profound and powerful application
of ideas of life,’ these two sonnets by Lampman quite
match the finest sonnets of the same degree of poetic vision
by Keats, Wordsworth, and Arnold:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>There we have, not talent cleverly performing an academic
exercise, but serene and noble genius profoundly
and finely interpreting and appreciating Beauty and Good
in the universe and in existence. Indubitably Lampman
is a master of the sonnet, a master whom those greatest
masters of the sonnet, Keats and Wordsworth, would welcome
to their company, and of whose company, as a nature-poet
working in the sonnet or the lyric forms, he really is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Lampman is more than a philosophical interpreter
of the mystery and wonder of Nature and Life. He is also
a consummate artist in revealing to others his vision of
the natural magic and beauty of Nature in Canada. He is
even a finer colorist and melodist than is Roberts. He is
such because he has finer powers of observation, and notes
not merely the general superficial beauty of the face of
Nature but also the minutest details of Nature’s physiognomy
and garb, and the gentler, more gracious of Nature’s
moods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unlike Roberts, Lampman is not a mere sensuous
impressionist. He is an artist with the same gifts as
those of Thomas Gray for discerning, appreciating,
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
and envisaging in lyric verse the subtler and lovelier
beauties of fields and woods and hills and streams and sky,
and for interpreting to the spirit the meaning of pastoral
beauty and life in Canadian woods. Roberts paints
charmingly indeed at times the mere face of Nature.
Lampman not only paints exquisitely and daintily the
physical loveliness and garb of Nature but also conveys
her most winsome moods and her daintiest messages for
the refreshment and sustenance of the spirit. Moreover,
Lampman has Gray’s gift in limning the human figure, of
adding, with graphic nicety, a humanistic touch to his
spiritual portraits. As a poet who paints and interprets
Nature with the intimate vision and delicate brush of the
artist, not with mere impressionism but with minute and
lovely truth and realism, and also as a poet who humanizes
Nature with graphic portraits and interprets Nature subtly
and intimately to the spirit, Lampman is a master by
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever influences Keats may have had on Lampman’s
art, it must be observed that fundamentally, as an
artist and as an interpreter of Nature, with the power to
add here and there graphic bits of human portraiture,
Lampman is nearer to Gray than to Keats or even to
Wordsworth. All these qualities are incisively exemplified
in Lampman’s lyric <span class='it'>Heat</span>. In this poem Nature and
pastoral life in Canada, on a day of sultry summer heat,
are painted with the nicest realistic detail; and in it the bit
of human portraiture, the wagoner ‘slowly slouching at
his ease,’ is as graphic and as true to life as Gray’s bit of
human portraiture, the plowman homeward plodding his
weary way, is graphic and true to English pastoral and
natural life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If any Canadian poet ever entered the sanctuaries of
Nature and revealed the intimate observation and consummate
artistry which marks the art of all the exquisite poets
of Nature—that Canadian poet is Archibald Lampman. He
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
is, however, a greater poet than he is an artist. As a poet
he is the superior of Roberts. As an artist he has no
superior save Duncan Campbell Scott. But as a poet of
Nature, interpreting from Nature the essence of the Canadian
spirit, Lampman is superb, supreme—unmatched, and
even unrivalled by any other poet that Canada has yet
produced.</p>

<h3>Bliss Carman</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>AS A WORLD-POET—CREATIVE MELODIST—PERIODS OF HIS
POETRY—SINGING QUALITY AND ITS METHOD—LYRIST OF
THE SEA AND OF LOVE—TREATMENT OF NATURE.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>B</span><span class='sc'>liss carman</span> is the only Canadian-born poet who
reasonably and inevitably challenges comparison with
English and United States poets of admitted distinction.
He is, in the continental sense of the term, more American
than he is Canadian; more English than American; and
more a world-poet than Canadian, or American, or English,
in the sense that famous poets writing in the English
language, from Chaucer to Masefield, are world-poets.
His genius and poetry, as do the genius and poetry of
no other Canadian poet, challenge criticism to define the
qualities of his mind and art. Unless, therefore, those
who have written <span class='it'>con amore</span> about Carman and have denoted
him as the greatest Canadian poet distinguish in
what respect or respects he is so to be designated, the distinction
is unmeaning. Carman is not the greatest Canadian
poet in versatility of genius, variety of themes and
forms, and perfection of technic or craftsmanship. He is
surpassed by Roberts in versatility of genius and variety of
forms. He is not the greatest Canadian nature-colorist or
impressionistic word-painter in verse. There again Roberts
surpasses him. Carman is not the greatest Canadian
poetic interpreter of nature in Canada and of the Canadian
spirit. Lampman is his equal, and, in one respect, his
superior. Nor is Carman the greatest Canadian artist in
narrative verse. Pauline Johnson and Edward W. Thomson
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
surpass him. Further, Carman is not, save in a special
sense, the greatest Canadian melodist. Pauline Johnson
and Marjorie Pickthall have a more dulcet singing lilt and
sensuous music. Finally, Carman is not the greatest, that
is, the nearest to perfection, in technical artistry, of Canadian
poets. Duncan Campbell Scott is his unrivalled master
in that respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet indubitably Bliss Carman is the very foremost of
Canadian-born poets. In Carman’s genius and poetry
there are an originality and power and beauty and distinction
that, first, make him unique amongst Canadian
poets and that, secondly, compel the critical world to admit
that he is the only Canadian-born poet who, whenever
he is the supreme lyrist and the inspired technician in verse
that he can be, has made a distinct, singular, and enduring
contribution of his own to English or world poetry, and,
on that account, is in the direct line of the Chaucerian
succession. Whenever, that is, Carman excels in sheer
genius, and as a nature-painter, nature-interpreter, story-teller
in verse, melodist and technician, he surpasses each
and all his Canadian compatriot poets at their best in their
specialty. They each excel in one or two powers. Carman
excels in all their combined powers, to the maximal
degree. Moreover, none of his Canadian compatriot poets
is his equal or even rival in originality and power of imagination,
in sheer vision of the metaphysical meanings of
nature and existence, in intensity of passion, in romantic
atmosphere, in satiric humor, in free and potent diction and
inevitable imagery, and in light or ecstatic lyricism. So
great is Carman as a poet of the Sea that he has made a
distinct contribution in this <span class='it'>genre</span> to English poetry. As a
lyric poet of romantic and Spiritual Love, he has no superior,
if even an equal, in Canada or America, and few in
any other country. His Elegies are lovely lyric memorials
of the Spirit. His poems of sheer joy of living or of
satiric humor have no prototypes. His symbolistic or so-called
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
mystical poetry, as an interpretation of the universe
and as a means of solace and serenity in the midst of
seeming Satanic triumphs, are as noble and grateful to the
spirit and as sustaining as the breath of life from his own
Maritime sea-winds and woodsy zephyrs. But when he
sings most freely and liltingly, then is Bliss Carman the
supreme melodist, and Chaucer is heard again in the land,
and the troubadours, and all those upon whom Nature bestowed
the gift of verbal <span class='it'>bel canto</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While, then, it is the challenging quality of Bliss Carman’s
poetry, as if he were directly of the strain of Chaucer,
Burns, Wordsworth, Browning, Tennyson, Swinburne,
Masefield, and as if his verse, like theirs, stood, as it does,
upright on its own feet, that gives it its first and most important
general distinction, it possesses other distinctions,
one of which, namely, its special verbal music, of Keltic
origin and form, is unique in Canadian poetry and rare in
modern English poetry. It is these particular distinctions
which stamp Bliss Carman as an extraordinary creative
poet and melodist, and as the one Canadian poet who
has a right to an indisputable place beside the finer and
more compelling poets of England and the United States.
These claims may be abundantly substantiated by a study
of the texts of what may be called the Popular Collected
Poems of Bliss Carman, namely, <span class='it'>Ballads and Lyrics</span> and
<span class='it'>Later Poems</span> (with an appreciation by R. H. Hathaway),
and by a study of such interpretative commentaries as Odell
Shepard’s <span class='it'>Bliss Carman</span> and H. D. C. Lee’s <span class='it'>Bliss Carman:
A Study of Canadian Poetry</span>, together with Hathaway’s
‘Appreciation’ in <span class='it'>Later Poems</span> by Bliss Carman. In this
chapter Carman is considered and treated from the three
sides in which he is unique amongst Canadian poets: namely,
as, in the light of the history of English poetry, a singularly
original and inventive Vowel Melodist; as a Nature-Poet
whose impressionism and ‘readings’ of earth differ
from those of Roberts and Lampman; and as a Philosophical
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
or Mystical Poet who perceives in Beauty the only
manifestation of the union of the Real and the Ideal and
regards it as an intuitive proof of the Supremacy of Good
in the universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However well-intentioned the attempts to divide the
poetical activity of Bliss Carman into <span class='it'>Periods</span>, on the whole
they are not pedagogically successful. Three Periods have
been remarked—a so-called Romantic Period, represented
by <span class='it'>Low Tide on Grand Pré</span> and the <span class='it'>Songs of Vagabondia</span>
series; a Transcendental Period, represented by <span class='it'>Behind
the Arras</span>, subtitled ‘A Book of the Unseen,’ which indicates
its mood, and <span class='it'>The Green Book of the Bards</span>; and a Synthetic
Period, in which his appreciation of the beauty of
earth is not contrasted with the evanescence and the mystery
of life, but in which there is a joyous acceptance of
both. This Synthetic Period is represented by <span class='it'>The Book
of the Myths</span>, <span class='it'>Sappho</span>, and <span class='it'>April Airs</span>. Yet in each volume,
from <span class='it'>Low Tide on Grand Pré</span> (1893) to <span class='it'>April Airs</span>
(1916), there is in varying degree the same ‘touch of
manner,’ the same ‘hint of mood,’ the same occupation <span class='it'>both</span>
with the beauty of earth and with the mystery and meaning
of existence and the universe. Really there is no development
of Carman’s genius and art—no periods of growth—after
his first book, <span class='it'>Low Tide on Grand Pré</span>, except an
increase in ready mastery, not of technic, but of <span class='it'>clear expression</span>
of thought and meaning. Some of his finest verbal
melody and some of his most compelling lines are in
his earlier volumes, and with them also embodiments of
his essential thought about life and the universe. But we
do note, in each succeeding volume, a gradual decrease in
Carman’s <span class='it'>sense</span> of world-pain (<span class='it'>weltschmerz</span>), and an increase
in <span class='it'>clearer expression</span> of his thought about the mystery
of life. To use musical language: in his earlier books
Carman heard <span class='it'>discords</span> in the universe. They were really
not discords but <span class='it'>dissonances</span>. As he grew older and reflected
more philosophically, he was able to resolve these
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
dissonances; and as he gradually achieved this, the more he
combined, with clarity and surety, his fine natural powers
of lyrical utterance with, to use Meredith’s phrase, his
’reading of earth,’ his intuitions of the ultimate supremacy
of the Good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since he fully recovered from the illness which attacked
him about 1919, Carman has entered on what promises
to be his greatest, most constructive period, the keynote
of which is his characteristic lyrical utterance in the
expressing of a confident synthesis of Sight and Faith, of
Beauty and Goodness. It is all the same verbal melody and
the same love of beautiful sound, color, and form as in
<span class='it'>Low Tide on Grand Pré</span>, but all the felt dissonances that
existed for thought have been resolved, and now existence
is filled with an ineluctable joy and a tender peace which
are a pure gain for the spirit. The poems which represent
the <span class='it'>new</span> Carman or the Carman of the <span class='it'>new</span> and final
period exist, for the most part in manuscript, though a few
have been published fugitively. We quote one of these
new fugitive poems, <span class='it'>Vestigia</span> (1921), in which the notable
qualities, aside from verbal melody and color, are a confident
synthesis of Sight and Faith, Earth and God, and
absolute simplicity and clarity of the diction and images:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fugitive poems representing this final period are <span class='it'>The
Mirage of the Plain</span>, <span class='it'>The Rivers of Canada</span>, <span class='it'>Kaleedon
Road</span>, and <span class='it'>Vancouver</span>, which contain mystical interpretations
’suggested,’ as Carman has said, ‘by the vast spaces
of Canada.’ <span class='it'>Apropos</span> of the mood, manner, and interpretations
of Nature in this period, Carman has observed: ‘All
Nature poems are more or less mystical.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>What we really observe, then, in Carman’s genius and
poetry is not genuine, clearly marked Periods, but rather
<span class='it'>Periodicities</span>—waves of poetical activity, in which the crest
of the wave is either lyrical ecstasy, the singing of the
Beauty of Earth for its own sake and out of love of beautiful
sound and color, or mystical ‘readings’ of Earth,
transcendental interpretations of the meaning of the life
of sentient and spiritual creatures, but below the crest of
the wave are poems of transcendentalism if the crest is
lyrical naturalism or poems of lyrical naturalism if the crest
is transcendental. Yet in these periodicities there is a sure
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
and well-demarcated development, not of technic, but of
clarity of thought and expression—from that earlier so-called
mysticism which was only mystification, to the
genuine mysticism which is the immediate intuition of God
in the universe and especially the immediate perception of
the oneness of the spirit of Nature with that of Man and
of God. But all the while, as the development goes on,
even to his final period, Carman remains the superb melodist
and colorist. So that Bliss Carman must be regarded
as at once both the most lyrical of Canadian philosophical
poets and the most philosophical of Canadian lyrical poets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carman’s prototype in sheer singing quality is Chaucer—the
first, freest, and sweetest of the English poets, whom
Tennyson apostrophized in avian metaphor as a ‘warbler.’
So in the same way Carman sings with the natural lilt,
abandon, and melodiousness of the lark and linnet. He is
a ‘warbler.’ It is an irrelevant criticism to say, as has been
said, that Carman ‘sings on and on,’ frequently in his earlier
poems, out of his own ecstasy over hearing the beautiful
verbal melody he is making, whether a given poem makes
sense in thought or not. He is not ecstatically singing on
and on from love of beautiful sound, but because he cannot
clearly express what he means in his thinking; and so we
hear the singing as if it were the accompaniment to the
thought which we cannot, any more than he, articulate.
But how lovely, how melodious the accompaniment!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of truth, however, we shall get at the secret
of Carman’s unique singing quality if we ask what is
the <span class='it'>method</span> of his warbling. It is in his method that he
differs from all modern English poets and has made an original
and distinct contribution to English lyrical poetry. This
is the fact: Bliss Carman is a belated troubadour or 16th
century English lutanist or Keltic harpist. Lutanists and
harpists created the text for their songs; and the prime
end was melody or at least melodiousness. The ultimate
element or unit in verbal melody with the lutanists or
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
harpists was the <span class='it'>word</span>, and the core of the word, for melodic
purposes, was the vowel. Poets arose in England, but
more especially in the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland,
who aimed to make the melody of unaccompanied
poetry imitate the melody of the lutanists’ and the harpists’
accompanied verses. The lutanists, harpists, and melodic
poets, who aimed to imitate music, passed, and new generations
of poets substituted metrical and stanzaic structure
and alliterative arrangement of consonants for the old
vowel-melody. The unit in English poetry, after the 16th
century, became the <span class='it'>line</span>, not the word or the vowel in the
word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the chief glory of Bliss Carman, as a creative poet,
that he brought back into English poetry the <span class='it'>word</span> and the
pure unimpeded <span class='it'>singing vowel</span>, with the same intent as the
Italian <span class='it'>bel canto</span> composers, as the unit in verbal melody.
Some critics have made considerable point of the fact that
Carman is a ‘great’ poet, <span class='it'>in spite</span> of the fact that he employs
chiefly the rhymed octosyllabic line or measure, or iambic
tetrameters and trimeters, with trochaic and anapaestic
substitutions and other metrical mechanics for variety.
The truth is that Carman wrote his poetry as a melodist,
not as a technical musician; that he aimed to <span class='it'>sing</span>, like the
lark or linnet, not to <span class='it'>compose</span>, like a musician. His measures
were chosen, whenever he meant to be lyrical, because
they were <span class='it'>singing</span> measures and his diction was chosen
for the melody inside the words, for the ‘vowel-chime’ in
them. In Carman’s lyrical poetry the word determines the
line, or rather the word alone counts, and the line is insignificant.
Dulcet vowel-melody or delicate vowel-harmony
is Bliss Carman’s chief original contribution to
Canadian and English poetry. Examples are innumerable.
Consider the clarion tones in this line, which as a line by
itself is perfect:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carman is as adept as Kipling in employing, for the
sake of verbal music and variety of rhythm, such devices
as shifting of accent, slurring, and elision, and, further, he
invents beautiful measures, as, for instance, the dimeter
of <span class='it'>Ilicet</span>, or the six-line stanza of <span class='it'>The White Gull</span> (Shelley):—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carman is also singularly adept in the use of what may
be called musical onomatopœia. In this quality his ear
is specially sensitive to <span class='it'>pianissimi</span> in Nature, the soughing
of the winds, the sighings and whisperings of the zephyrs,
the fifings and murmurings of the insects (with Carman
the crickets always ‘fife’ and the bees ‘murmur’), and, to
use his own phrase, all the ‘tiny multitudinous sound’ of
rustling leaves, dancing grasses, crooning brooks, tinkling
rain, which make the instrumentation of the Toy Symphony
of Nature:—</p>

mere sound imitation. An outstanding example of the

<p class='pindent'>Always, from his very first book, <span class='it'>Low Tide on Grand
Pré</span>, to his latest, <span class='it'>April Airs</span>, published almost a quarter of
a century later, Bliss Carman has been the master troubadour,
the master melodist, constructing his melody chiefly
by an exquisite but subtle use of vowel-tones, vowel-harmonies.
But never has he aimed to be the consciously
meticulous technical musician, laboring at involved and
intricate metrical and stanzaic structure, assonance and alliteration.
His verbal melody is in the word and vowel
as his ear naturally picked these up from everyday speech,
and is just as spontaneous and simple. His melody did not
come by ‘working at’ it in the study. We may often note
Roberts, and even Lampman, assiduously busied with constructing
the perfect musical line. Carman’s melody
wells out of him in the ‘great outdoors’—natural and
spontaneous as the lark’s or linnet’s. By virtue, then, of
this spontaneous lyrical melodiousness of Carman’s poetry,
a melodiousness <span class='it'>newly based</span> on the vowel-tones and harmonies
in words, simple words of actual humanized speech,
and not on modern intricacies of line or stanzaic structure
and consonantal systems, Bliss Carman is one of the
master-melodists of English poetry.
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus as a melodist in general. Canada, however, has
produced no poet who is Carman’s equal as a lyrist of the
Sea and of Love. It is indubitable that he has made a
distinct and superb contribution to the authentic Sea Poetry
in the English language. His sea ‘speech’ is the native
speech of his soul, the expression of an innate personal
sympathy with the moods, powers, and deeds of the Sea,
a sympathy which is, in Carman, an <span class='it'>identity</span> of the spirit
in Nature with the spirit in the Man or Poet. Melodiously
he declares this personal sympathy and identity with the
Sea in his autobiographical poem, <span class='it'>A Son of the Sea</span>:—</p>

Haven: A Book of the Sea</span> (1897) is a genuinely unique
anthology by itself—‘one hundred pages,’ as a London
critic has said, ‘of salt sea without a trace of Kipling, and
yet having a sea-flavor as unmistakable as his, and with a
finer touch—with less repetition, less of mere technicality,
and a more varied human interest.’ For Carman the Sea
is a <span class='it'>human personality</span>. Its moods and deeds embrace all
the contradictory moods and deeds of human beings. But
whatever mood or deed of the Sea is expressed by Carman,
he does it with pure and perfect lyricism. Carman is said
to have no gifts for spiritual portraiture. Yet what English
or American poet has matched Carman’s portrait of
the Sea as a shambling, fierce, grim, rollicking, burly, cruel,
crooked, old man, and at the same time created such a
brave and lilting song of the Sea, as in <span class='it'>The Gravedigger</span>,

<p class='pindent'>When a poet gives us such realistic portraiture and
such inimitable lyrical melody and rhythm as does Carman
in <span class='it'>The Gravedigger</span>, it is a futile criticism to find fault with
his sea poems on the side of lack of dramatic elements, and
weakness in narrative, since the <span class='it'>strength</span> of the poems was
meant by the poet to be their inherent passional intensity
and melody. Carman’s sea poems were not meant to be
strictly dramatic narrative tales of the sea, but to be ballads
or songs of the <span class='it'>romance</span> of the sea. We may remark,
as a general observation, that as a balladist of the Sea,
Carman does not aim at dramatic narration, but at singing,
with the freedom and picturesque vernacular and technical
slang of sailors, as they would sing their chanteys, the
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
romance, happy or grim, of the sea. As songs, his so-called
ballads of the Sea are a supreme achievement in
verbal melody, the glory of Canadian sea poetry, and one
of the glories of English poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the master melodist or musician of the Sea, Carman
brilliantly achieved, but he is equally the master melodist
or musician of Romantic and Spiritual Love. His Love
Poetry is best represented in <span class='it'>Songs of the Sea Children</span>
(1904) and in <span class='it'>Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics</span> (1904).
Earlier he had written lightly, as it were flirtingly, about
love. But in <span class='it'>Songs of the Sea Children</span>, while he wrote
as daintily or delicately as in his earlier poems dealing with
the passion, he has at last realized the spiritual intent and
meaning of pure devoted love, and has been moved deeply
and inspired by the passion. Though copyright restrictions
forbid full quotation, the spirit or mood or temper, and
the pure melody, of <span class='it'>Songs of the Sea Children</span> may be
gathered from this single stanza:—</p>

<p class='noindent'>The rhymeless stanzas of the love poems in <span class='it'>Sappho</span> are
high-minded, but are a poetical <span class='it'>genre</span> by themselves. They
are a <span class='it'>tour de force</span> in ‘poetical restoration,’ and, perhaps
for the first time, we actually observe Carman at work in
the study as the technical verbal artist and musician. They
have a technical perfection, and a quiet beauty of their
own, and though there is in them a large degree of spontaneity,
naturally they are not informed with the characteristic
Carman lyrical ecstasy and melody. They are,
as love poems, perfect as the love poetry of Sappho was
fleckless with a Greek perfection of form and grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bliss Carman is not properly called a nature-<span class='it'>interpreter</span>.
To understand his point of view we must contrast
his with that of Lampman. For Lampman Nature is one
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
kind of being and Man is another—two separated entities—and
Man may only commune with Nature by ‘reciprocal
sympathy.’ So Lampman goes out to his Canadian maples
and elms, fields and streams, and <span class='it'>talks to</span> them, <span class='it'>as if</span> they
were human, and can sympathize with him. This is all
simulated imaginative sympathy and communion on the
poet’s part. The maples and elms, fields and streams, are
really dumb, and the poet does but attribute to them what
speech or answer he wants back from them for the solace
of his spirit. Always with Lampman, Nature and Man
are <span class='it'>two</span>. He does but humanize Nature for his own purposes,
by conscious, deliberate <span class='it'>objective symbolism</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carman, on the other hand, is a spiritual monist. Nature
and Man are not two. There is, in Carman’s poetical
psychology and metaphysic, no mind <span class='it'>and</span> matter. The
whole universe is spiritual through and through, and the
vital spirit which is in Nature is the same spirit which
is in Man and which is God. The universe is wholly spirit.
We may call this ‘the higher pantheism;’ but even in pantheistic
doctrine, matter does exist as alien to mind or
spirit. Carman has no such attitude. He differs from
Lampman in conceiving himself as able, by spirit or will,
to <span class='it'>identify himself personally with Nature</span>. This power
of personal identification with Nature begets personal sympathy;
and the communion which the poet has with Nature
is a ‘heart-to-heart talk,’ for spirit with spirit can meet.
This new philosophy of personal identity of the human
spirit with Nature is expressly declared by Carman:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>But specially to be noted is the fact that Carman does
not stand apart from Nature, from the woods, and flowers,
and hills, and streams, and become an <span class='it'>interpreter</span> of Nature’s
moods and emotions. Nay, the poet enters into the
tree or flower and becomes one with their soul or spirit,
their body becomes his body, and their voice, as heard in
his poetry, is but his voice articulating to the world what
they are unable to articulate. Nature, in Carman’s poetry,
is become vocal; and the poet himself is her very Voice.
Metaphors in the nature-poetry of Carman are not metaphors
at all; they are direct experiences of spirit:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>This personal identity of the human spirit with the
spirit in (or of) Nature, this personal sympathy with the
poet’s <span class='it'>kin</span> in wild Nature, and this taking on as a body the
matter and form of a tree or flower or bird or other
creature of Nature, and becoming vocal for them, and thus
uttering <span class='it'>their</span> thoughts, and feelings, and emotions, is new
in Nature poetry, and original with Bliss Carman. It is
not Greek; it is not English; but it is Canadian and unique.
It is Carman’s most notable contribution to world poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This spiritual monism in Carman’s poetical attitude to
Nature explains the seemingly strange commingling of
songs of pure delight in the beauty and bounty of Nature
and of joy in existence with poems which are the expression
of a poet who has ‘kept watch o’er man’s mortality.’
It explains such contradictions as the joyousness of some
poems and the metaphysical questings of others in Carman’s
From the <span class='it'>Green Book of the Bards</span> (1903). It
explains, in particular, why Carman, who, when he wishes,
can surpass Roberts as a nature-colorist and whose poetry
is actually rich in idyllic impressionism, never seems to set
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
out, with conscious intent, to be a nature-colorist or word-painter
for the sake of sheer impressionism. No other
Canadian poet can make or has made such a brilliant use
of primary colors or such an exquisite use of
delicate tints and evanescent play of light on color as
has Bliss Carman. In all his nature description or impressionism,
Carman’s aim has been two-fold—first, ‘to
better the world with beauty,’ and to compel appreciation
of Nature wherever her sweet or solacing spirit abides, to
reveal the haunt where Nature affords spiritual communion
and refreshment. His aim, in short, is to have
men go out and meet Mother Nature. To effect this, not
to show how flashily she is dressed, Carman paints her face
and garb sometimes brilliantly, sometimes with a grey-eyed
loveliness. Carman’s poetry of Nature is only Nature
herself ‘calling’ to each vagabond to rise and go out to
meet her, ‘wherever the way may lead.’ This two-fold
aim of Carman’s nature-painting or poetic impressionism is
compellingly expressed in <span class='it'>A Vagabond Song</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the keynote of Carman’s poetry is Joy in the
universe, he is no mere hedonist. The beauty he loves is
uranian, the Joy he aims to get from Beauty and to share
with the world through his poetry is <span class='it'>spiritual</span> joy. What
he has always been sure of was that the dissonances in the
world and in existence were resolvable, but he himself
gradually had to resolve those dissonances, and win full
and complete joy in Nature, in Love, and in Religion. If
we call him a Philosophical Poet, we must do so only after
we understand that his belief in the supremacy of the Good
or of God is intuitively derived. Carman is not philosophical
by virtue of having employed the faculty of relational
thinking for the attainment of his belief in the moral
meaning of life and the universe. He perceived Beauty
in the world, and, after much obfuscation of the immediate
meaning of Beauty, Carman at length perceived it as a
symbol and pledge of the union of the Real and the Ideal.
Only in the sense that Beauty is a symbol of perfection
does Carman regard Nature as a symbol of God; and only
in the sense that God, like Beauty, can be directly or immediately
perceived, is Carman a mystical poet. If there
is one thing of indubitable ill that science and philosophy
have accomplished, it is their dogmatizing that because
science and metaphysics with their categories cannot find
out God as an actuality, much less can the senses. The
pseudo-mystics took science and philosophy at their word,
and said the only way to find God is by the use of the
religious imagination. Whereupon they so strained the
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
imaginative faculty to achieve what they called mystical
union with God that their mysticism only resulted in mystification.
Science, with its categories, only cast a veil
over Truth, over the face of God. Pseudo-mysticism only
placed an opaque void between God and the Sons of God
called Men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is because Carman was in his early manhood caught
on the wheels of agnostic science, transcendental metaphysics
and pseudo-mysticism that in his earlier poems
this lover of Beauty sings entrancingly of Beauty and winsomely
paints her dwelling-places, but while doing this he
also mystifies his readers with regard to the meaning of
his poetry. The music is all accompaniment to something
that Carman himself does not in his own soul clearly understand.
Hence the wistfulness and melancholia observable
in many of Carman’s earlier poems; hence his sad engagement
with the problem of death, as in <span class='it'>Pulvis et Umbra</span> and
<span class='it'>The Eavesdropper</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carman could not have written <span class='it'>Vestigia</span> at that period.
For that poem is based on an immediate <span class='it'>sense</span>-intuition of
God in Nature and in the heart of Man. It was his gradual
negation of the categories of science and metaphysics and
vacuous pseudo-mysticism, and an instinctive return to an
intuitive perception of the meaning of Beauty in Nature
and Love and Religion that cleared his vision, and gave
him a sure and clear understanding of the supremacy of
the Good or God, and that thus won for him triumphant
spiritual Faith, Joy in existence, and Peace with God. This
is the true mysticism, the true union with God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is an interesting excursion in spiritual history to
trace Carman’s gradual escape from ‘mystical mystification’
into the triumphant faith of true, earth-born, sense-perceived
mysticism, as in <span class='it'>Behind the Arras</span> (1895), <span class='it'>By
the Aurelian Wall and Other Elegies</span> (1898), <span class='it'>Last Songs
from Vagabondia</span> (1901), <span class='it'>From the Book of Myths</span>
(1902), <span class='it'>From the Book of Valentine</span>s (1905), and <span class='it'>Collected
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
Poems</span> (1904). It was a ‘mystified’ Carman who
wrote <span class='it'>Pulvis et Umbra</span>. It was a truly mystical Carman,
possessed of a triumphant faith who a full twenty years
afterwards wrote <span class='it'>Te Deum</span>, the concluding verses of which
follow:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The immediate sense-perception of God through Beauty
and the acceptance of Beauty as a factual proof of the
union of the Soul with Nature, of the Real with the Ideal,
and thus a proof of the supremacy of Good in the universe—this
is the formula of Carman’s philosophical ‘reading’
of Nature and Existence. Always a poet of fine and assured
artistry and of lyrical eloquence and spiritual power,
Bliss Carman stands alone amongst Canadian poets as a
verbal melodist, as a lyrist of love and the sea, and as a
mystical interpreter of the moral and spiritual meaning of
nature and existence. As an original verbal melodist and
poetic impressionist and as an unexampled creator of songs
of the sea, Bliss Carman has added significantly to English
and to world poetry and to him, therefore, we may apply
the distinction Great.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>n</span> the poetry of Duncan Campbell Scott there is more
and finer expression of the pageantry of Nature in
Canada and of the essential Canadian spirit than in the
verse of any other Canadian poet. But, paradoxically, the
genius and poetry of Duncan Campbell Scott are also more
informed with an Old World culture and art than are the
genius and verse of any other Canadian poet. Unless the
reader and the critic of D. C. Scott’s poetry first realize
that the mind and art of the poet are a product of Canada
and of the Old World, a rare commingling of Canadian
and European cultures, they will fail to understand how
he is at once the least prolific and, to give him his outstanding
distinction, the most exquisite artist of Canadian
poets, not excepting Lampman and Bliss Carman. In his
poem <span class='it'>Frost Magic</span>, Scott has written the formula of his
own exquisite artistry:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Silvered in quiet rime and with rare art.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>That line, however, rather distinguishes the characteristic
excellence of his poetry on the technical side. It does not
disengage the quality which makes him unique amongst
Canadian poets. His <span class='it'>differentia</span>—the quality or power
which distinguishes his poetic genius and craftsmanship
from the mind and the art of all other Canadian poets—is
Style. Duncan Campbell Scott is the one Canadian
poet of whose verse it may be said that, after the manner
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
of the English tradition, it possesses <span class='it'>Style</span>. Lampman’s
and Carman’s, Pauline Johnson’s and Marjorie Pickthall’s,
poetry each possess a style. But in their cases the style
is imitable; it is a <span class='it'>manner</span>, original or ingenious no doubt,
but not an essential and inevitable expression, of their poets’
minds or personalities. Duncan Campbell Scott’s poetry
has style, quite as individualistic as the others’, but it is
an essential expression of his personality and character,
and is therefore inimitable, or like the man himself, is in
‘the grand manner’—which is not at all a manner but just
that subtle spiritual quality which distinguishes individuals
in species. The genius and poetry or art of Duncan
Campbell Scott, then, impose on us a special and somewhat
recondite study in literary psychology.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The key to Duncan Campbell Scott’s genius and poetry
is this singular, if not anomalous, spiritual fact that his
Art always, corresponds with, and never contradicts, his
Thought and Life. In this ‘tri-unity’ of complete ‘correspondence’
of Thought, Life, and Art, Scott’s analogue
is Matthew Arnold. The English poet was, above all
things, the austere intellectualist. So, too, Duncan Campbell
Scott is the austere intellectualist. But, unlike Arnold,
Scott’s ‘austerities and rejections’ are not those of the
substance of poetry but of its temper and technic. While
it is true that Scott is the remorseless idealist as man and
active citizen, and while the light that chiefly plays on his
poetry is the ‘dry light’ of the intellect or imaginative
reason, it is equally true that in his heart there is the warm
fire of love of humanity and Nature and all the humanizing
arts, and that the dry intellectual light which most notably
illumines his poetry is colored, at times delicately or subtly,
at times brilliantly, at other times magically, with the substance
and color of Nature in Canada and of modern music
and painting. As in the man and citizen, as in his Thought
and Life, there is a high plane of refined and serene vision,
feeling, and deed, so in his poetic Art and Style the outstanding
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
qualities are serene Dignity and exquisite Beauty.
It is always a manly and refined art; and its sensuous
Beauty is made spiritual by sincerity, delicacy or nobility
of thought and by imaginative truth. Never in it is there
sentimentality, or vulgarity, but always <span class='it'>humane</span> beauty and
dignity which derive from delicacy of spiritual vision and
sincerity, and from restraint in technical artistry. As an
example of these excellences in Duncan Campbell Scott’s
poetry—of its dignity and beauty, refinement and restraint—we
quote this surpassing compliment to woman’s spiritual
loveliness and charm, <span class='it'>Portrait of Mrs. Clarence Gagnon</span>
(from Scott’s <span class='it'>Beauty and Life</span>):—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Beauty is ambushed in the coils of her</p>
<p class='line0'>Gold hair—honey from the silver comb</p>
<p class='line0'>Drips and the clustered under-tone is warm</p>
<p class='line0'>As beech leaves in November—the light slides there</p>
<p class='line0'>Like minnows in a pool—slender and slow.</p>
<p class='line0'>A glow is ever in her tangled eyes,</p>
<p class='line0'>Surprise is settling in them, never to be caught;</p>
<p class='line0'>Thought lies there lucent but unsolvable,</p>
<p class='line0'>Her curved mouth is tremulous yet still,</p>
<p class='line0'>Her will holds it in check; were it to sleep</p>
<p class='line0'>One moment—that white guardian will of hers—</p>
<p class='line0'>Words would brim over in a wild betrayal,</p>
<p class='line0'>Fall sweet and tell the secret of her charm,</p>
<p class='line0'>Harm would befall the world, Beauty would fly</p>
<p class='line0'>Into the shy recesses of the wood—</p>
<p class='line0'>Be seen no more of mortals, be a myth</p>
<p class='line0'>Remembered by a few who might recall</p>
<p class='line0'>A nerveless gesture, a frail color, a faint stress,</p>
<p class='line0'>Some vestige of a vanished loveliness.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>This ‘strong and delicate art’ of Scott’s was itself the
outcome of years of training in delicate perception or
visioning of Nature and the human Spirit and in the practice
of spiritual refinement and restraint in art or technical
craftsmanship; and also of assiduous cultivation in the
technical appreciation of modern music and painting. Born
in 1862, Duncan Campbell Scott did not publish verse till
he was some years past his majority, and did not publish
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
his first book of poems till he was thirty-one years of age
(<span class='it'>The Magic House and Other Poems</span>, 1893). For more
than forty years he has been in the Civil Service of Canada,
and for some years has been Deputy Superintendent General
(a title and function equivalent to Deputy Minister)
of the Department of Indian Affairs of the Dominion.
Archibald Lampman was a contemporary and a close friend
of Scott. Lampman was a student of the poetry of Keats
and much influenced by the verse of the English poet. In
1894 Scott married an accomplished lady, who was a violin
virtuoso. He had published fugitive poems in magazines
before 1893. (His poetry was later the subject of a very
complimentary critical appreciation by William Archer in
<span class='it'>Poets of the Younger Generation</span>). He had finished his
academic studies at the public schools and at Stanstead
College by his seventeenth year, and had then entered the
Civil Service of Canada. So that the three influences on
his mind and art are, first, that which began with his friendship
with Lampman; secondly, his marriage with a cultured
musician, and, thirdly, his long tenure of office in the Department
of Indian Affairs of the Dominion of Canada.
To his association with Lampman, rather than to his teachers
at school and college, must be attributed his reading of
the English poets and the cultivation of poetic technics.
It is not until after his marriage and after his long association
with certain Canadian painters that we find in
his poetry any ‘color’ from music and painting. His connection
with the Department of Indian Affairs resulted in
those lyrics and legends which have for themes the Indian,
the French-Canadian, and the Beauty of Nature. Lampman
as co-student of the English poets, especially Keats
or the idyllic impressionists, and as a co-worker in creative
poetry, especially the poetry of Nature, was the most potent
or subtle influence on Scott. This, however, was an influence
<span class='it'>ab extra</span>. The most important <span class='it'>inner</span> influence on
Scott was his own intellectual rigorism and austere respect
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
for chaste or faultless craftsmanship. But for this rare
virtue, which was innate in him, Scott would or might
have been a more prolific poet, and might have been a
close imitator of the English impressionists or Lampman
himself as a nature-poet, or of Bliss Carman as a lyrist
of Nature and of Love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no denying that Lampman had considerable
influence, negative and positive, on Scott, and that the
negative influence was the more important. At any rate,
by choice Scott decided to be a poet who, while caring as
much for Nature as did Lampman and Carman, would care
supremely for refined perfection of technical artistry in
his verse. It is easy to observe the general differences
between Lampman and Carman and Scott in attitudes, and
in methods of poetic conception. Lampman is the more
subjective, the more interested in his own emotions; Scott
is the more objective, disclosing a delight in the object
for its own sake or a philosophical interest in humanity and
life. Lampman is the more passionate; Scott the more
restrained or austere (without being ascetic). Lampman
is the more sensuously luscious (though not always);
Scott the more lucid and luminously colorful. Carman is
the more naturalistically sensuous, and his pigmentation is
limited to the pageant of Spring and Autumn; Scott is the
more imaginatively sensuous, and paints every phase of
the pageantry of Nature in the cycle of the seasons of the
whole year. Carman is more a melodist, basing his melody
on vowel-chime in words; Scott is more the musician, the
technical virtuoso—or, in other words, Carman <span class='it'>sings</span> or
<span class='it'>lilts</span>, like the lark; Scott <span class='it'>performs</span>, like the violin or flute
virtuoso, though each in his way is as entrancingly lyrical.
Carman is the more vernacular in diction, employing considerably
the actual speech of everyday life; Scott is the
more recondite, and therefore the more meaningful, in
diction—‘a word virtuoso.’ But it is not true to say, as
has been said, that Scott is a ‘poet’s poet.’ He is, when
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
he aims to be, just as lyrical, musical, colorful, and simple
in diction as Lampman or Carman, but he is also more
delicate or chaste, more fanciful or imaginative, more
lucid or luminous, and always more subtle in diction and
exquisite craftsmanship. So that whenever Scott envisages
or interprets Nature in Canada and the essential
spirit of Canada, more than any other native-born poet he
puts more of Canada in it and does it with a singular and
surpassing beauty of diction, imagery, music, color, and
general technical artistry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in outline, as regards the Canadian influences
on Scott’s genius and poetry. It is necessary also to note
the influence of Old World culture on his genius and art.
For, like Bliss Carman’s, there is a challenging quality in
Scott’s poetry which compels favorable comparison of it
with the verse of English and United States poets of distinction.
But while influences of certain English poets
are remarked, this does not mean that Scott is derivative
in inspiration or method of treatment, but that the influence
was either on his ideals of what poetry is or on his meticulous
practice of technical artistry in verse; or, in a phrase,
their influences have been those of inspiring him to distinction
in Style and Technic. In Scott’s noble monody in
memory of his father, <span class='it'>In the Country Churchyard</span>, the formal
structure and the elegiac elevation of thought fill the
heart with a serene beauty which discloses the influence of
Gray. There is a distinct Wordsworthian spirit and flavor
to <span class='it'>Above St. Irénée</span>. A haunting beauty, which is of the
quality of Tennyson, pervades Scott’s title poem of his
first volume, <span class='it'>The Magic House</span>. Unmistakable is the influence
of Rossetti on the form and tone-color of Scott’s
sonnet sequence, <span class='it'>In the House of Dreams</span>, but there is
enough of Scott’s own originality and ingenuity in inventing
Western-world metaphors and in vowel-melody and
alliteration to distinguish it as Scott’s or as Canadian or
Western. The sonnet form is Rossettian, the mediaeval
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
atmosphere and setting are Pre-Raphaelite, as are also the
personages:—</p>

<p class='noindent'>All the English poets mentioned were, however, not
formative influences. At best what seems imitations of
the manner of Gray, Tennyson, Rossetti, Keats, Swinburne
are but recrudescences, quite unconscious and original,
in Scott’s poetry. Scott is a nature-colorist, or impressionist,
verbal musician and metrist, romanticist, and
philosophical interpreter of Nature and Life on his own
account. The real formative influences in Scott’s genius
and art were the climate, atmosphere, seasons, and the color
and drama of varied Nature and Humanity, of Canada;
his compatriot poet of Nature, Lampman, and perhaps
Carman, and these three English poets, Browning, Arnold
and Meredith; and, finally, his appreciation and knowledge
of the technic of music and painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considering his qualities as a verbal musician and
metrist, we may note that while Scott employs all the technical
artifices of other Canadian and English poets, such as
vowel-melody and harmony, alliteration and consonantal
changes, beautiful measures and rhythms, he differs from
his compatriot poets by informing, as did Browning, the
substance of his poetry with an intimate use of the technical
language of music, allusions to musical literature, and
the aesthetic values of music. The texts of his poems show
that he is acquainted technically with the music of Bach,
Beethoven, Brahms, Grieg, such romantic moderns as
Raff and MacDowell and such ultra-moderns as Debussy
and Ravel. To anyone who has heard Beethoven’s Fifth
(C-minor) Symphony, how arresting and emotionally impressive
is the allusion to the principal motive of that great
work, in these lines from Scott’s <span class='it'>The Fragment of a
Letter</span>!—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p class='line0'>Then quick upon the dark, like knocks of fate,</p>

<p class='line0'>Came back the echoes true to tune and time,</p>
<p class='line0'>Three axe-strokes—rhythmed and matched in rhyme.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Again: it is not poetical pedantry on Scott’s part when,
in his elegiac monody <span class='it'>On the Death of Claude Debussy</span>, he
rhapsodizes the forms, content, properties, color, and
musical structure—‘the mood pictures’—of Debussy’s
opera <span class='it'>Pellèas et Mélisande</span>, his orchestral prelude <span class='it'>L’Après-midi
d’un Faune</span>, and his orchestral sketches <span class='it'>La Mer</span>. No
musical journalist or critic, writing in prose, has done this
so summarily and with such vividness and veracity as
Scott has accomplished it in twenty-five lines of trimeter
and tetrameter unrhymed iambics and trochaics. It is for
the sake of illumination and the substance of true poetry
that Scott thus finely incorporates his knowledge of music
into the text of his poetry. And, as Browning made compelling
use of the technical language and meanings of musical
structure, notably in his <span class='it'>Abt Vogler</span>, so, in the Debussy
monody, Scott twice finely affects the spirit and illuminates
the substance of his poem with such recondite musical
technology as:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And under all, the <span class='it'>pedal-point</span></p>
<p class='line0'>Of the deep-bas(s)ed ocean,</p>
<p class='line0'>Hidden under the mists,</p>
<p class='line0'>Chanting, infinitely remote,</p>
<p class='line0'>At the foot of enchanted cliffs.</p>
<p class='line0'>Then with a turn of illumination,</p>
<p class='line0'>An <span class='it'>enharmonic</span> change of vision,</p>
<p class='line0'>Death and Debussy</p>
<p class='line0'>Become France and her heroes,</p>
<p class='line0'>As if all her sacred heroes</p>
<p class='line0'>Were in that one form,</p>
<p class='line0'>Clasped in the bosom of France,</p>
<p class='line0'>Enfolded with her ideals and aspirations.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>The felicity of the phrase ‘the pedal-point of the deep-bas(s)ed
ocean’ is apparent to anyone who is musically
trained and who immediately hears the sustained stationary
bass of the sea reverberating while mingling with its
thunder are chords and progressions of wave plashings and
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
wind harmonies, all combining to make the sublime Symphony
of the Sea. Still more remarkable and illuminating
is Scott’s use of the phrase ‘an enharmonic change .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Death and Debussy.’ In music an enharmonic change is
but a change in notation of intervals and chords, the sound
of them remaining the same. And so how felicitous
Scott’s use of ‘an enharmonic change of vision!’—Death,
Debussy (who died in the last year of the late war),
France, and her war heroes. These terms are all synonymous
of ‘one form,’ the spirit of France; there is only
an enharmonic change in notation or name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this is, on Scott’s part, a brilliant and—as far as
Canadian poetry is concerned—a unique achievement in
incorporating musical ideas and essences and technics
to color, illuminate, and enhance poetic meanings. But
Scott surpasses himself in this matter, creating something
really unique in poetic literature, in his <span class='it'>Variations on a
Seventeenth Century Theme</span>. It is the most ingeniously
conceived poem, if not in English poetry, at least in continental
American poetry; and it is a signal illustration of
that Old World culture which was remarked as part of the
challenging quality in Scott’s poetry. The poem is ‘programmatic’
in scheme, comprising ten sections which are
‘free variations’ on a Nature theme (the yellow of the
primrose), inspired by two lines from Henry Vaughan
(17th century):—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>It was high spring, and all the way</p>
<p class='line0'>Primrosed, and hung with shade.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The ten sections or ‘variations’ or ‘movements’ of the
poem are such niceties in imitation of the forms of music
that they should be properly indicated with form or tempi
nomenclature, inasmuch as the poet has not done this at
the head of each section or ‘variation.’ Variation I is a
Prelude (in the old style), the diction of which is Chaucerian
or early 15th century English. Variation II is a
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
triple-time Vivace movement (old form of the Scherzo)—a
fetching bit of lively ballad-song. Variation III is a
Largo movement, noble and impressive. A short Nocturne
follows in Variation IV, which is succeeded by a movement
that may be styled Dramatico, a short poignant ‘play
within a play,’ dealing with the tragedy of romantic love.
Variation VI is an Intermezzo, a contrasting change on
‘Youth is a blossom yellow at the edge.’ Variation VII
is a Funeral March for fairies, and is fairy-like in imagery
and music. By itself it is as pretty and winning a poem
for children as any in our language:—</p>

<p class='noindent'>Variation VIII is a very human Burlesca—a ‘<span class='it'>genre</span> picture’
of the comedy of life in Old London, with the ‘motive’ of
a socially outcast old woman looking at pots of primroses,
labelled ‘Only a quarter,’ and fingering a coin, trying to
decide whether to buy primroses or spend it on beer for
herself and ‘dear old Jerry.’ The pathos of its realism is
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
relieved by the piquancy of the spiritual portrait of the
outcast old woman, in whose soul there is still a fine redeeming
loyalty to a real heart-love. Variation IX is a
Folk Song in the manner of Burns. It is followed by a
Finale, which returns to the Vaughan theme, and closes
with its couplet. The Finale is ennobled with tender reflections
or philosophical interpretations of the drama of
earth and existence, in which Scott beautifully maintains
and expresses Serene Faith in the permanence of Beauty
and Love. From this magnificent and genuinely unique
poem, we quote Variation IX, as an example of Scott’s
gifts as a song-writer. If it is in the manner of Burns
or an imitation of one of his best-known songs, it is as
informed also with the spirit of Herrick, but it is melodious,
by vowel-music, alliteration, and rhythm, in a way
which was not in the power of Herrick or Burns:—</p>

<p class='noindent'>In that song-lyric we find Scott’s characteristic dignity and
beauty. But fine and beautiful as it all is, the music of it
is not the <span class='it'>natural</span> melodiousness of Herrick or Burns, of
the lark or linnet, but the music of the adroit technical
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
musician who is a ready master of all the resources of
modern versification and metrics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards these technical resources of verbal melody
and music—vowel—‘tone-color’ and harmonies, alliteration,
assonance, rhythm of line and stanza and other metrical
structure, and even what is called in music as such
’suspension’—Scott challenges the art of Keats, Tennyson,
Swinburne, Arnold, and the Laureate, Sir Robert Bridges.
In one instance, Scott has made the most happy and ingenious
use of what musicians call ‘chord suspension’—that
is, the retaining in any chord some notes (or tones)
of the preceding chord. Scott achieves it finely in this
cadence:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>With the thrushes fluting <span class='it'>deep, deep</span>,</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Deep</span> on the pine-wood hill.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>This effect of ‘suspension’ in verbal music is not new
in poetry, but it is infrequent in the poetry of the Anglo-Saxon
people. A melodious example is the opening stanza
from Collins’ <span class='it'>Ode to Evening</span>:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>If aught of oaten stop, or pastoral song,</p>
<p class='line0'>May hope, chaste Eve, to soothe thy modest ear,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Like thy own solemn <span class='it'>springs</span>,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Thy springs</span>, and dying gales.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>With Collins the ‘suspension’ is an artifice rather than
an inspiration. With Scott, it is, in the example instanced,
an inspiration. No other modern poet, certainly no other
Canadian or American poet, has Scott’s gift of verbally
phrasing, with the utmost concreteness, imitative realism,
and charm the ‘notes’ of bird songs and their meaning. In
the cadence quoted, the effect of the ‘suspension’—‘deep,
deep, deep’—is a happy realistic imitation of the tone-color
of the thrush’s flute-like notes, and the triple reiteration
affects the imagination with that charm which we distinguish
as ‘haunting.’ Carman has not this gift of concreting
bird-songs. Carman uses only the general epithet.
One bird simply ‘whistles;’ another ‘flutes.’ Carman
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
would have written the lines quoted from Scott not only
without ‘suspension’ but also without any concrete, realistic
imitation of the thrush’s notes and suspensions, thus:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>With the thrush’s fluting</p>
<p class='line0'>On the pine-wood hill.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Scott not only makes a masterly and felicitous use of
concrete tone-color epithets in phrasing the songs of birds,
but he also knows how important and eloquent in music as
such, as well as in the songs of birds, are pauses or silences,
and uses this appreciation of silences exquisitely. Scott’s
artistry in both these respects is finely shown in these
lines:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Then paused self-charmed to silence</span>.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Scott, in truth, on the side of exquisite realistic concretion
of the notes and cadences of bird-songs, has the
ear of a <span class='it'>naturalist</span>—and a better ear than Thoreau or Burroughs.
Scott is the ‘bird-musician’ <span class='it'>par excellence</span>. Witness
the naturalist’s exquisite ear for concrete realism in
these lines:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>Reel remote the <span class='it'>ululating laughter</span> of the loons.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Carman would have stopped with the general word ‘drumming’
in the phrase ‘hear the partridge drumming’—not so
Scott; he must realistically concrete the reverberance of
the drumming in the phrase ‘rolling out his mimic thunder.’
And what realistic concretion is in the phrases ‘in ringing
wild persistence,’ and ‘ululating laughter!’ Carman half
hears. Scott hears with the ear of the naturalist <span class='it'>and</span> the
musician.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, only the ear of the naturalist and the musician in
Scott could have so exquisitely, veraciously, concreted the

<p class='pindent'>Scott knows the ‘voices’ of instruments as intimately as
those of birds and other feathered wild creatures. How
finely he combines a concrete use of his two-fold musical
knowledge in this respect in the following ingenious and
original bit of verbal instrumentation:—</p>

<p class='noindent'>The reader must be a naturalist and, as well, have been a
bandsman or orchestral instrumentalist to feel the felicitous
realism and descriptive exactitude of Scott’s art, or rather
inspiration, in inventing that figure of the owl as a musician.
The humor of it also is exquisite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scott surpasses all other Canadian poets in a genius for
inventing single and double terminal rhymes, and he excels
in this gift, without ever dropping to impossible or
bizarre rhymes, except when the comedy of life in a subject
naturally requires the use of a vulgarism as in this couplet
from the Burlesca movement (VIII) of <span class='it'>Variations on a
Seventeenth Century Theme</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>As ready and expert as Carman with such other musical
resources as vowel-melody and harmony, assonance, consonantal
tone-color and alliteration, Scott is more lyrically
melodious than even Carman. Melodiousness—dulcet melody
of combined vowel and consonant and rhythm—is the
supreme musical quality of Scott’s poetry. Not Tennyson
nor Swinburne have surpassed the melodiousness of this
stanza from Scott’s <span class='it'>The Lover to His Lass</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a question difficult of settlement whether Duncan
Campbell Scott is greater as a verbal colorist and nature-painter
than as a melodist. But there can be no doubt
that as a verbal colorist and nature-painter he has the eye
both of the naturalist <span class='it'>and</span> the impressionist. And it is
indubitable that as a colorist or impressionist he has put
more of the pageantry of Nature in Canada into his poetry
than has even Bliss Carman. All the Canadian seasons
are in it, and every phase of the light, color, and sound
of the Canadian year is in it—done by ready, flexible,
graphic stroke or exquisite touch, in rich or luminous and
translucent coloring, with romantic eye and fantasy, and
with singular ingenuity and power. It must be confessed
that there is a seeming display of musical theory and technics,
of musical learning, which almost savors of pedantry,
in those of Scott’s poems which contain musical thought
and imagery. This would be sophistication, were Scott
not sincere and did he not sincerely use it all to enhance
the poetic effect of his verse on the tonal sensibilities and
the imagination. But there is no sophistication, no mere
display of knowledge of pigments and the technic of
painting in his work as a verbal colorist. He is a word-painter,
a nature-colorist, an impressionist,—by innate
genius. As a matter of fact, too, almost all his verbal
melody is associated with color. So that, by genius rather
than by art, Duncan Campbell Scott may be regarded as
the supreme verbal colorist amongst Canadian poets. He
is this for three reasons—inclusiveness of the seasons and
phases of Nature in Canada, magic of pigmentation, and
novelty and imaginative power of coloring and description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the poems of Scott abound in arresting and compelling
phrases, lines, and stanzas of alliterative beauty,
the number of brilliant and luminous color phrases, lines,
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>

<p class='pindent'>It was said that there is more of Canada in the poetry
of Duncan Campbell Scott than in the verse of any other
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
Canadian poet. So far this appears to be true of Scott’s
painting of Nature in Canada. Scott, it must be observed,
is a Nature <span class='it'>painter</span>, never a Nature <span class='it'>interpreter</span>, as were
Lampman and Carman. Yet there is in Scott’s poetry a
decided interpretative or philosophical element. It is on
the side of his philosophical poetry that Scott’s verse contains
more of the Canadian <span class='it'>spirit</span> than does the verse of
any other Canadian poet. As a philosophical poet Scott
is, first, an interpreter of humanity and life in Canada—and
his interpretations possess highly novel distinction and
spiritual import. His philosophical poetry is contained in
three volumes, <span class='it'>Labor and the Angel</span> (1898), <span class='it'>New World
Lyrics and Ballads</span> (1905), and <span class='it'>Via Borealis</span> (1906).</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his <span class='it'>New World Lyrics and Ballads</span>, Scott aims to
reveal the kind of mind or thought which the strange
humanity of the Northwest in Canada—the Indian heart
in the wild North of Canada—contains. In the volume
Indian themes predominate, and the so called Ballads are
more aptly named Legends, because Scott’s Ballads are art
and the product of a reflective mind <span class='it'>thinking into</span> Indian
mind the thoughts of a civilized man, whereas the genuine
Ballad is a spontaneous story told in simple verse. Moreover,
Scott’s genius is lyrical; but in these so called Ballads
he attempts dramatic situation and emotion. It all lands
him in recondite psychological symbolism, as, for instance,
in <span class='it'>The Mission of the Trees</span> or in <span class='it'>The Forsaken</span>, which is
later attempted in <span class='it'>The Half-Breed Girl</span> (from <span class='it'>Via Borealis</span>),
a striking essay in Indian introspection. What we
get from these poems is Scott’s perception and revealment
of spiritual Beauty in loneliness—his half-mystical intuition
that the spirit in civilized man, in the Indian soul, and in
Nature everywhere is one and the same spirit, and that
civilization has only resulted in veiling the face of God
and in separating his creatures from one another and from
the Creator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This vague mystical intuition of the mystery and yet
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
identity of spirit in man and Nature is beautifully, perhaps
too sensuously, envisaged in Scott’s <span class='it'>Spring on Mattagami</span>
(from <span class='it'>Via Borealis</span>). This poem is seductively musical
and highly impressionistic, but shows the influence of
Meredith (<span class='it'>Love in a Wilderness</span>) in its interpretation of
the conflict of Love and Law in the universe. What
counts and solaces, however, is the Vision or Light of a
higher Love and a deeper Law that lie behind the seemingly
meaningless conflict of the visible love and law. After
all, the poet, like the rest of mortals, can only ‘trust’ in
the supremacy of Good in the universe:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>This abstract mystical symbolism is Old World, not
Canadian, not Scott’s own philosophy of the spirit for the
Canadian spirit. His own is found in his poem <span class='it'>Labor and
the Angel</span>. It is original and noble in conception; and,
consistently with its serious didactic purpose and ideas, or
symbolism, its diction is vernacular, its form and rhythm
are suited to plain narrative; and the whole is devoid of
Scott’s luxuriant color and sensuous melody. It is a dramatic
poem in the sense that it is designed to affect the
heart and the imagination with dramatic force and truth.
As a criticism of life in the Arnoldian sense, we see in the
poem the influence of Matthew Arnold. But its thought
and style show more notably the influence of Browning
and Meredith, especially in its syntactical ellipses, bald and
abrupt lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In its way, <span class='it'>Labor and the Angel</span> is as finely and as impressively
achieved as Tennyson’s <span class='it'>Princess</span>. It answers
a question which is particularly pertinent to Canada where
work—the gaining of material subsistence—necessarily is
paramount, because inevitable and pressing. As with
Browning, so with Scott, Woman is man’s life-star and
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
inspiration. In the poem <span class='it'>Labor and the Angel</span>, the Man
and the Girl are common humanity, but the Girl, who is
also the Angel of Labor, is the man’s companion and helpmate:—</p>

the end of her companionship and love and the spiritual
fruits of that love, every man, who is obedient to the ideal,
transmutes the lowliest labor into spiritual purpose, meaning

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>n</span> the early nineties of the last century three young
Canadian poets, who were employed in the Civil Service
Departments at Ottawa, were closely associated in a
systematic way as men of letters. They were Wilfred
Campbell, Archibald Lampman, and Duncan Campbell
Scott. In the Toronto <span class='it'>Globe</span> they conducted a department
of literary criticism and ‘causerie’ under the caption ‘The
Mermaid Inn.’ Oddly, these three young Canadian men
of letters were singularly dissimilar in poetic temperament,
attitudes, vision, and ideals. As a poet Lampman was an
interpreter of the inner meaning of the beauty and moods
of Nature. He and Nature communed with each other
by reciprocal sympathy, and he cared greatly for style and
craftsmanship in poetry. Duncan Campbell Scott loved
beauty for its own sake as a spiritual delight or source of
ecstasy, but perfection of form, style, artistry—‘art for
art’s sake’—pre-empted all other considerations in poetry.
Wilfred Campbell occupied a middle ground. He was an
objective Nature-painter, with tendencies to be more interested
in Nature as a habitat or background of the human
spirit which had come from God and was going to God.
He was solicitous about form and imagery, color and
melody in poetry, but for him these were always a means
to an end, never a mere end in themselves. Or, harking
back to influences, we may say that Lampman wrote poetry
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
with the eye and the spirit of Keats and Wordsworth; Scott
with the eye of Matthew Arnold for naturalistic and moral
beauty and chaste artistry; and Campbell in the spirit of
Longfellow and Emerson, and, sometimes, of Tennyson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Campbell it was the substance or matter,—the
ideas, thought, and meanings for the spirit—not the formal
elements or manner of poetry, that counted for most. It
is the substance of poetry, its meanings for the spirit, that
counts always for most with the people. For this reason,
though Campbell is not the greatest of the poets of the first
Systematic School, he is, and will remain, as he has been
called, ‘the poet of the people’s choice.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>A distinct evolution—and advance in vision—from objective
nature-painting of the spirit can be observed in
the successive volumes of Campbell’s verse. Naturally,
until he had reflected on his aims as a poet, he did not announce
his poetic creed in his first volume of verse. He
did this in his fourth volume, <span class='it'>Collected Poems</span> (1905) in
his poem <span class='it'>Higher Kinship</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Not of the senses’—Campbell is not a lover of impressionism
for its own sake, but he loves the simple,
colorful aspects of Nature for the joy, comfort and peace
which they give to ‘<span class='it'>the inward soul</span>.’ He has his equals as
an impressionistic colorist, but he is supreme when he paints
a phenomenon or aspect of Nature in monotone or in subdued
tones as in pastel, or when he etches a scene with a
Whistler-like feeling for atmosphere, shadow, and chiaroscuro,
and for line. In 1888, when he was in his twenty-seventh
year, Campbell published a booklet of twenty lyrics,
<span class='it'>Snowflakes and Sunbeams</span>. In these first lyrics he disclosed
the eye of monotonist and etcher for the beauty of
Nature. The verse in this rare little volume is marked,
too, by a grace and melody which enhance the pictures.
What but a ‘symphony in white’ is his <span class='it'>Snow</span>—</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Folding the farms,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And the river’s great arms,</p>
<p class='line0'>Kissed by the chill night</p>
<p class='line0'>From clamor to rest,</p>
<p class='line0'>Lie all white and shrouded</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Upon the world’s breast.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Thus, through several stanzas, he paints Nature in
white, seemingly for the joy of the senses but really for
‘the inward soul.’ For a moment he obtrudes the ‘message’
which the snow conveys to the moral imagination—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Falling so slowly</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Down from above,</p>
<p class='line0'>So white, hushed and holy,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Folding the city</p>
<p class='line0'>Like the great pity</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of God in his love;</p>
<p class='line0'>Sent down out of heaven,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;On its sorrow and crime,</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Beautiful as an original image is the thought of the
snow descending hushed and holy, ‘like the great pity of
God in his love,’ but it is a sentimental obtrusion, out of
character with the snow-picture as such. We find Campbell
frequently creating the most engaging Nature pictures,
and here or there in a poem recalling the eye from the pure
visual delights to let the moral imagination reflect on
some suggestion, some similitude, for ‘the inward soul.’
What a pretty pastel, for instance, he paints with spare use
of mere tints, in the first two stanzas of <span class='it'>In the Study</span>:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And high up over</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The chimney’s soot cover</p>
<p class='line0'>The winter night has begun.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Or memory’s lost-land,</p>
<p class='line0'>Seems to conjure up wraiths from the past.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>But Campbell does not continue the strict painting of the
objective picture. He introduces something ‘for the inward
soul,’ as he does, in the concluding stanza:—</p>

<p class='line0'>And a sweet face is close to my cheek.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>This is not a fault in Campbell’s poetry. It is an
essential part of his art. As in Longfellow, so in Campbell
the <span class='it'>humanized substance</span> of his verse is consciously designed
for the popular heart, and ensures popular acceptance.
Campbell would rather do this than to write always for
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
art’s sake, as in these sheer pictorial stanzas from <span class='it'>A Winter’s
Night</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, he can employ delineative line with swift and sure
artistry just to make a picture for its own sake, disclosing
absolute mastery in economy of means, as in his

<p class='pindent'>That is an exquisite bit of naturalistic etching with a
poetic meaning intrinsically in the picture of the Maiden
Morn standing and dreaming in the mist. The picture

Campbell also possessed the faculty of painting vividly, as
with a single sweep of the brush, as in his <span class='it'>Lake Huron</span> (in
October) and its memorable lines:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Campbell did not aim or strive to be a word-virtuoso.
But what he could achieve as an artist was to make at will
a dainty or a glorious <span class='it'>picture</span>, and so <span class='it'>localize</span> the picture
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
that one can immediately tell which section of the Canadian
land or waters is delineated. He surpassed all his contemporaries
in the gift of ‘flashing’ a vivid picture in a
single line, as, for instance:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last line quoted also discloses in Campbell a power
which is not in any other Canadian poet—the Miltonic
power of conveying by description ideated sensations of
unending space and movement. Matching almost any
piece of sheer description of immensity by Milton is
Campbell’s compelling panorama of Lazarus in his flight
from Heaven to Hell and the sensations of illimitable
depths downward that it creates in the reader, as in these

<p class='pindent'>As a poet of humane patriotism, which has regard for
international or world relations, and which is not mere
‘drum and trumpet’ patriotism, Campbell stands in a class
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
by himself. He had a Keltic love of place or home. It
was a passion with him, but the passion embraced the
Anglo-Saxon peoples. So that his patriotic poetry contains
a large element of the ideal of Anglo-Saxon unity and of
the imperialistic destiny of the British peoples. Thus we
find him singing with equal warmth of Scotland, the homeland
of his ancestors (as in <span class='it'>The World-Mother</span>), of
England (as in his <span class='it'>To England</span>), of the United States (as
in his <span class='it'>To the United States</span>), and of Canada, his homeland
(as in <span class='it'>Canada</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sincere and profound sense and love of brotherhood
is the key-note of his patriotic poetry. There is no magniloquent
bombast in it, whereas it must be admitted that
Roberts’ <span class='it'>Canada</span> and his <span class='it'>Ode to the Confederacy</span> have at
least an air of pomp of words which sound like mere magniloquence
or bombast. But there is in Campbell’s <span class='it'>Canada</span>
a sincere sense of history, of historical background and
heroic origins, as well as of a people whom the vastness of
their habitat should impel to a great and noble destiny.
Besides, Campbell sings of the homeland in simple octameter
couplets, the very simplicity of which impresses the
spirit with a deep sense of truth and reality. The poem,
with a slight change or two for choral singing would, if
set to dignified and sonorous music, be fitted to be an inspiring
and inspiriting National Hymn. It is a colorful,
lyrical poem, a Song, suffused with the qualities of the
Canadian spirit and the beauties of the Canadian habitat.

<p class='pindent'>Wilfred Campbell, then, appears as a lyrist of Nature
and poet of the Spirit, who is an adroit and vivid objective
colorist and etcher, but who, for the most part, tinges his
lyricism of Nature with meanings for the ‘inward soul.’
With equal dexterity and truth he painted an impressionistic
or a <span class='it'>genre</span> picture. But in doing this, he was unexcelled
by his contemporaries in Canada in economy of means for
expression. While, however, he was thus given to painting
or delineating Nature in Canada, he also appears as a poet
who ‘hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality.’ He gave proof
of this in a singular way. Whatever other distinctions
belong to him, Campbell has never been equalled, by another
Canadian poet, in the Dramatic Monologue. Perhaps, in
view of the special meaning which Browning has given
to this species of poetry, it were better to use the formula
Dramatic Monody. For this phrase better describes
Campbell’s poignant, compelling <span class='it'>Unabsolved</span>, <span class='it'>The Mother</span>,
and <span class='it'>Lazarus</span>. But however categorized, these poems reveal
the fact that Campbell’s genius was essentially dramatic.
This dramatic instinct in him, Campbell developed
to a high degree until he essayed the five-act poetic drama.
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
It is as a Poetic Dramatist that Campbell achieved a distinct
and fixed place in Canadian creative poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first poet to attempt nativistic or native poetic
drama in Canada was Charles Mair, who published at Toronto,
in 1886. <span class='it'>Tecumseh: A Drama</span>. Many of its characters
are Canadian and much of its setting and color are
Canadian. Mair had created a work of real interest, of
excellent structure and dramatic development, and had used
impressively Canadian properties, character, and environment.
The verse is genuinely artistic and colorful and
dramatic, and the poem as a whole is worthy of critical
consideration; but only as the first example of Canadian
native poetic drama is <span class='it'>Tecumseh</span> to be regarded as significant
in the literary history of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much superior to the dramatic poetry of Mair is that
of Wilfred Campbell. It is considerable in quantity, comprising
the following (as he called them) ‘poetical tragedies
and dramas:’ <span class='it'>Mordred</span>, <span class='it'>Hildebrand</span>, <span class='it'>The Brockenfiend</span>,
<span class='it'>Robespierre</span>, <span class='it'>Daulac</span>, <span class='it'>Morning</span>, <span class='it'>Sanio</span>, and <span class='it'>The Admiral’s
Daughter</span>. The quality of his poetical tragedies and dramas
distinguishes him as the first really important creator of
poetic drama in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The titles of his poetic tragedies and dramas clearly indicate
that, with one exception, his subjects were derivative
and his treatment traditional. With the exception of his
<span class='it'>Daulac</span> he took his subjects from Arthurian legend and
European romantic history. He was considerably under
the influence of Tennyson. Though he gave us an interesting
and arresting poetic drama with his <span class='it'>Daulac</span>, it is
specially notable as a drama which is Canadian in subject,
character, and setting. He was not so successful with it
as with his poetic drama based on Arthurian legend and
romantic history. The reason is that in a large degree he
possessed an ‘Old World,’ a Keltic imagination, and his
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
imagination was deeply impressed and moved by the romance
of mediaeval heroic exploits:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Old, unhappy, far-off things,</p>
<p class='line0'>And battles long ago.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The heroism of Daulac, his combats and other heroic
exploits were so near in time to the age of Campbell himself
that they could not affect the poet’s imagination so
pervasively and compellingly as do the older mediaeval
romances of heroic exploits. Campbell did not feel the
<span class='it'>Daulac</span> story as he had felt the Arthurian or romantic
legends of Europe. He, therefore, did not, because he
could not, put into his <span class='it'>Daulac</span> the same power of imagination
and dramatic characterization and reality that he put
into his other dramas. But <span class='it'>Daulac</span>, notwithstanding, is a
noble poetic drama; and since it is Canadian through and
through, in subject, in setting, and in authorship, we may
estimate it as the first native poetic drama of genuine art
and power in the creative literature of Canada.</p>

<h3>Pauline Johnson</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>HER ANCESTRY AND ITS INFLUENCES—LITERARY AND
MUSICAL QUALITIES OF WORK—STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT IN
SPIRITUAL VISION—PICTURESQUE COLOR VERSE.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>he</span> name, life, and poetry of Pauline Johnson affect
the heart and imagination with the arresting pathos
which attaches to the imperishable memory of a belated and
beautiful spirit who came singing new and winning music
of earth, and man, and love. She was the most elementally
human of all Canadian poets. In some respects Pauline
Johnson was the most original and engaging singer in the
company of the Canadian lyrists who were born in 1860,
1861, and 1862—Roberts, Carman, Lampman, Campbell,
and Duncan Campbell Scott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pauline Johnson’s grandfather, who attained special
glory for his valorous deed of setting fire, with his own
hands, to the city of Buffalo in the War of 1812, was distinguished,
in times of peace, by his tribesmen with the honorable
and poetic sobriquet, ‘The Mohawk Warbler,’ not
because he could actually ‘warble’ like a present-day lyric
tenor, but because he possessed a ready flow of language
which he used with impassioned and dramatic eloquence.
The old warrior’s granddaughter, in her ballads and poems
of Indian wrongs and Indian heroic deeds, wrote with the
same dramatic intensity and the same gift for dramatic picture;
and in her songs of Nature and of love sang with a
lyrical lilt as natural, musical, free, and passionate as the
warblings of the thrush or lark or linnet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distinctive qualities of Pauline Johnson’s genius
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
and poetry are here noted summarily. In general: As a
story-telling balladist she must be ranked with the best
Canadian poets who have essayed the same <span class='it'>genre</span>, though
in some of her ballads there are lines which are rhetorical
and melodramatic. On the whole, however, her story-telling
ballads are unsurpassed by her Canadian <span class='it'>confrères</span>,
in emotional intensity, rapid movement, terse phrasing, and
dramatic pictorial vividness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a verbal musician, and as a nature-painter and etcher,
Pauline Johnson again must be given a very high place.
Some of her poems are marked by absolutely avian <span class='it'>abandon</span>;
others by haunting melody; and others by sweetly flowing
rhythm and winning cadences, and by sensuous vowel-harmonies
and faultless rhymes. Many of her poems
disclose the gift to paint in words a picture from Nature
with the impressionist’s mastery of sensation and color.
Some of them are low-keyed and full of shadows, suggested
sensations, and mystery. Others are dainty word-etchings,
picturesquely or subtly drawn and subdued in tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In particular: Pauline Johnson has yet, by other Canadian
poets, to be equalled as a lyrist of the passion and
pathos of romantic love, and as an inventor of picturesque,
veracious, vivid, beautiful, and compelling poetic figures
and images. Her love poems are full of the most poignant
passion and pathos. It would be easy to make a catalogue
of a half hundred or more poetic figures and images which
are unique in descriptive aptness or in emotional ‘tang.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>In short, the supreme spiritual and aesthetic qualities of
Pauline Johnson’s poetry are its real sincerity, its naiveté
of thought, its simplicity of structure, its lovely color images,
its winning music, its passion, pathos, and womanly
tenderness. But first place must be given to its dulcet and
insinuating music and to its original and arresting poetic
figures and images.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pauline Johnson, taking the date engraved on the monument
to her memory at Vancouver, was born in 1861. She
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
died at Vancouver in 1912. She was the youngest child
of a family of four born to the late G. H. M. Johnson
(Onwononsyshon) of Brantford, Ontario, Head Chief of
the Six Nations Indians, and his wife, Emily S. Howells,
who was of English parentage and born at Brixton, England.
Pauline Johnson (Tekahionwake) was born on her
father’s estate, which is on the Reserve apportioned the
Mohawk Tribe by the Canadian government. It must,
therefore, pique the imagination to know that Pauline
Johnson was of pure Indian and pure English descent, but
that though she travelled from coast to coast in Canada
and the United States and twice to England, her freedom
of movement was ‘privileged’ and she was always, wherever
she went, a ‘ward’ of the Canadian government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Pauline Johnson’s case there are nice, though not
recondite, problems in literary psychology and interpretive
criticism. For instance: Was Pauline Johnson’s genius
Indian, or English? Was it inherited, or was she a ‘born’
poet, or how else may her gifts and tastes be explained?
The poet herself always insisted, with considerable pride,
on her Indian origin. Some critics, reasoning by quasi-inductions,
abetted her in this belief. Yet, so far as her
genius is concerned, the only one of her Indian ancestors
who had anything like literary gifts was her grandfather,
‘The Mohawk Warbler,’ and his gifts were those of the
‘tongue’ in compelling eloquence rather than aesthetic
sensibility and the power of expressing in words the beauty
and the music in Nature. On the other hand, Pauline
Johnson’s English ancestors were a family who possessed
distinct literary tendencies and habits. The most distinguished
member of the branches of that family was W. D.
Howells, the American novelist, poet, and essayist. It is
most probable that she inherited her literary gifts from her
English ancestors. For in <span class='it'>Flint and Feather</span>—her complete
poems—there is not one concept, or bit of color, or rhythm,
or anything else, that may be described as specifically Indian.
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
Rather it is all British or Universal. We do find
in her poems Indian themes, protests against British ruthlessness
in governmental treatment of the Indian, and the
celebration of Indian valor and love. But these are human
utterances. Moreover, of the ninety poems in <span class='it'>Flint
and Feather</span>, only eight concern the Indian, and these only
on the side of episodes which formed good material for
romantic story-telling in verse. In these fine ballads
Pauline Johnson became indeed the ‘Voice’ of her inarticulate
Indian fellows, but the voice itself was that of a
woman cultured in the forms and music of English poetry.
Pauline Johnson’s loyalty to the Indian side of her ancestry,
and her pride in it, were admirable; but, if heredity is
to be accepted as a real cause of genius, her taste for
literature, and her bent towards literary expression, must
have come from her mother’s side. For her mother was
both a cultured and a romantically-minded woman. If,
however, we are to grant the poet any gift from her Indian
ancestry, we must remember her brilliant career as a reciter
or dramatic reader. If she inherited this dramatic
gift, then she got it from her eloquent grandfather, ‘The
Mohawk Warbler.’ Though she used it conspicuously in
her dramatic readings, the gift is also observable in the
vividly graphic qualities, and in the emotional intensity, of
her story-telling ballads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pauline Johnson was the first genuinely Canadian
‘daughter of the soil’ who indubitably was born a poet;
and her poetic development was one not in artistic craftsmanship,
but in vision. The first important fact in her
spiritual history is that at a very early age the future poet
evinced an original and intense taste for verse, expressing
this taste both by a fondness for memorizing verses read to
her and for composing childish jingles about familiar domestic
objects. A pretty illustration of Pauline Johnson’s
early predilection for poetry is furnished in the Biographical
Sketch to <span class='it'>Flint and Feather</span>, in which it is related
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
that when she was but four years old (1865) she was asked
by a friend who was going to a distant city what he should
bring her as a gift, and that the child-poet replied, ‘Verses,
please!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second important fact in Pauline Johnson’s spiritual
history is that from the time she could pen words intelligently
up to the close of her public-school days she
devoted much of her leisure to self-cultivation in the appreciation
and the writing of verse. Before she was twelve
years old (1873), Pauline Johnson had thoroughly read
Shakespeare and the British romantic poets, Scott and
Byron, and with their texts cultivated her native sense of
poetic diction and imagery, of verbal rhythm and music
(vowel-harmony, rhyme, consonance, assonance, alliteration),
and of color-epithets for brilliant and subtly impressionistic
word-painting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pauline Johnson, with rare good sense, did not publish
any of her verses till considerable time after she had completed
her formal schooling and her personally conducted
studies of versification, verbal music, and poetic imagery.
But as soon as she began to offer her verses to editors, she
seems to have found ready acceptances. The first periodical
to welcome her verse was a small New York magazine,
<span class='it'>Gems of Poetry</span>, published, presumably, in the early ’80’s of
the last century. This, however, can not be regarded as a
significant event. Really significant was the fact that <span class='it'>The
Week</span> (founded by Goldwin Smith) was the first Canadian
magazine to publish her verse. This fact assured her the
recognition and sponsorship of Goldwin Smith, himself an
eminent man-of-letters and a poet, and also, possibly, of
Charles G. D. Roberts, who was literary editor of <span class='it'>The
Week</span> in 1883-1884, and who was the first editor to stand
sponsor for Archibald Lampman. The imprimatur of <span class='it'>The
Week</span>, or the sponsorship of Goldwin Smith and Roberts,
automatically elected Pauline Johnson to the company of
the Systematic Group of Canadian poets born in 1860,
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
1861 and 1862, and introduced her to the English-speaking
world as a new and authentically gifted singer, in whose
music, though formally composed in the English manner
of versification, would, in due time, be heard the hitherto
unheard melancholy over-tones and wildwood notes of the
aboriginal Canadian spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next important date in Pauline Johnson’s history is
the year 1892, when a happy social and literary <span class='it'>soirée</span>
launched the Indian poet on a public career which, seemingly,
would not affect, save negatively, Pauline Johnson’s
function and art as a lyrist. From that date and for
sixteen years (1892-1908), Miss Johnson assiduously applied
her gifts as a reciter and dramatic reader in Canada,
the United States, and England, all the while publishing
intermittently in the periodical press her best verse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1895, simultaneously at London, England, Boston,
and Toronto, appeared her first volume of poems, <span class='it'>The White
Wampum</span>. In 1903 her second volume of poems, <span class='it'>Canadian
Born</span>, was issued at Toronto. In 1912, also at Toronto,
there was published the definitive and inclusive edition of
her collected poems, <span class='it'>Flint and Feather</span>. All three, upon
their appearance, were highly praised in reviews by the
critics of England, the United States, and Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is important to appreciate the significance of Pauline
Johnson’s sixteen years of travelling over Canada, the
United States, and England, as a reciter and dramatic
reader. Possibly they reduced the amount of her poetic
output. But there are no evidences in <span class='it'>Flint and Feather</span>
that the experiences gained during these years diminished
or increased her powers of poetic vision or craftsmanship.
Pauline Johnson was self-deceived when, in a letter, she
expressed her belief that the fugitive verses published in
<span class='it'>Flint and Feather</span>, pages 135-156, surpass her poems in
<span class='it'>The White Wampum</span> and in <span class='it'>Canadian Born</span>. ‘My later
fugitive verse,’ she declared, ‘is, of course, my best work,
as it is more mature.’ There are only fifteen of these so-called
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
fugitive poems; but imaginative, musical, and tender
as they are, notably <span class='it'>In Grey Days</span>, <span class='it'>Autumn’s Orchestra</span>,
<span class='it'>The Trail to Lillooet</span>, <span class='it'>The Lifting of the Mist</span>, <span class='it'>The King’s
Consort</span>, and <span class='it'>Day Dawn</span>, they are all in the early manner
of the poet. They are lovely and winning poems, pervaded
with seductive music, tone-color pictures of nature
and of life, tinged with a tender pathos. But they show
no advance in technique, verbal music, imagery, or emotional
nuance—no lately acquired powers to express
rhythmic ecstasy with a newer and more musical lilt than
obtains in <span class='it'>The Song My Paddle Sings</span> (1892); or to paint
with more suggestive impressionism a nature picture full
of color, half-lights, or mystery, or more finely to etch a
verbal portrait than she has done in <span class='it'>Erie Waters</span>, <span class='it'>Marshlands</span>,
<span class='it'>Shadow River</span>, and <span class='it'>Joe</span>; or to catch and envisage
a mood or emotional nuance with subtler spirituality than
she accomplished in <span class='it'>The Camper</span>, <span class='it'>Lady Lorgnette</span>, <span class='it'>Lullaby
of the Iroquois</span>, <span class='it'>Prairie Greyhounds</span>, <span class='it'>Lady Icicle</span>, and <span class='it'>The
Prodigal</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these poems, whose titles have just been quoted, were
composed in the decade from 1892 to 1902, and belong to
Pauline Johnson’s first two volumes which together contained
sixty-seven poems of indubitable lyric and imaginative
quality. Of the poems composed by Pauline Johnson
in the decade from 1902 to 1912, only twenty-three
were deemed by the poet worthy to stand beside her poems
from <span class='it'>The White Wampum</span> and in <span class='it'>Canadian Born</span> which,
with the later twenty-three, form the contents of the
original edition of <span class='it'>Flint and Feather</span>. Five posthumously
published poems were added to the later editions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If, then, in <span class='it'>Flint and Feather</span> we discover no advance
in the technique of Pauline Johnson’s art, wherein did her
new experiences gained by travel, by meeting men and
women of foreign lands and by learning the ways of the
world, work changes worth while? Solely in the poet’s
heart and imagination. Here was a development, not in
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
craftsmanship and art, but in spiritual vision. It was, too,
an evolution simple and natural in its stages, and is readily
traceable in the poems contained in <span class='it'>Flint and Feather</span>. Mr.
Melvin O. Hammond, an observant and judicious Canadian
critic, in a review of <span class='it'>Flint and Feather</span> (<span class='it'>The Globe</span>,
Toronto, Nov. 9th, 1912), was the first to disclose these
stages of Pauline Johnson’s development in spiritual vision.
They are four:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, Pauline Johnson appeared as the ‘voice’ of the
Indian people, who before her coming had been dumb or
inarticulate. Her point of view was, at this stage, Indian,
and she passionately protested against the abuses the Indians
of Canada have suffered (as in <span class='it'>The Cattle Thief</span> and
<span class='it'>A Cry from An Indian Wife</span>) or, as passionately, sang
of Indian valor and love (as in her <span class='it'>Ojistoh</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next, her point of view became Canadian. She turned
from lamenting the free and glorious past of her Indian
ancestors to paint in verse the land of her birth, ‘Canadian
life and scenery in the broad outdoors of the North and
West,’ not merely impressionistically picturing woods, skies,
plains, but also apostrophizing and humanizing both
natural creatures and objects, as if they were conscious of
their estate, function, and value to man, and had moods of
their own, as, for example, <span class='it'>The Sleeping Giant</span> (Thunder
Bay), and the dainty, fetching lyric <span class='it'>The Homing Bee</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third stage in Miss Johnson’s development in vision
was also Canadian. But, in this stage, her point of view
became broadened in scope. She turned to remark the
progress of the Canadian national spirit and the civilization
which binds the Dominion from ocean to ocean. This she
accomplished with extraordinary virility in rhythm, with apt
descriptive epithet, and with pictorial suggestiveness in her
<span class='it'>Prairie Greyhounds</span>—a song represented as sung by the
trans-continental trains in their passage from East to West,
and West to East. The poem gives the reader vivid ideated
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
sensations of the swish and roar and onward rush of the
trains, the sweep of the vast territory of the Dominion,
and the vision of the Greater Canada that is to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The final stage in Pauline Johnson’s increase in scope
of spiritual vision was marked by cosmopolitanism, pure
humanity, and by mysticism. She had lost the Indian and
the Canadian points of view when she composed <span class='it'>Give
us Barrabas</span> (commemorative of the exile of Dreyfus).
She was wholly a human being and sexless when she composed
her subtly sympathetic <span class='it'>The City and the Sea</span>, and
<span class='it'>Fasting</span>. She was genuinely mystical when she composed
her <span class='it'>Penseroso</span> wherein she sang persuasively:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Soulless is all humanity to me</p>
<p class='line0'>To-night. My keenest longing is to be</p>
<p class='line0'>Alone, alone with God’s grey earth that seems</p>
<p class='line0'>Pulse of my pulse and consort of my dreams.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>To authenticate the claim that Pauline Johnson’s genius,
art, and poetry are highly original and sometimes unique,
it is only necessary to cite such of her poems as represent
the stages of her development and the special qualities of
her poetic vision and artistry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beginning with the first stage, we must observe that her
passionate protesting against the abuses which the Indians
of Canada had suffered as, for instance, in her poems <span class='it'>The
Cattle Thief</span>, and <span class='it'>A Cry from an Indian Wife</span>, is no proof
that the fierce intensity of her utterance is a recrudescence
of ancestral Indian fire of spirit or ferocity in herself. The
poems in which this so-called Indian emotional intensity
was expressed by her did, no doubt, spring out of imaginative
sympathy with her father’s race, but these poems
could have been written with the same show of emotional
intensity by any other poet who realized with equal imaginative
sympathy the wrongs that the Indians of Canada
had suffered and who had the gift of fiery expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pauline Johnson is fundamentally Indian when she
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
is most pagan; that is, when, first, she realizes and expresses
poignantly her racial sense of haunting presences in the
natural world, and when, secondly, she expresses a melancholy
regret for the passing of her Indian race and a yearning
for free and pagan communion with the moods of
Nature, with the wild creatures of Nature, and with the
spiritual presences, which, to the imagination of the aboriginal
Indian, haunted the woods, the streams, the mists,
the clouds, and the sunsets before the hated British race
destroyed the Indian’s ancestral habitat and robbed him
both of his material and spiritual birthright. Moreover, in
the two or three poems in which she protested against the
wrongs which the Indians of Canada had suffered, Pauline
Johnson was really, if unconsciously, <span class='it'>affecting</span> to be the
‘voice’ of her Indian race. For she soon turned from such
affected poetic frenzy to expressing her admiration of the
British and her love of Canada as a free commonwealth
under British allegiance and protection, and to revealing in
colorful and musical verse the spirit and beauties of the
land of her birth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pauline Johnson, then, is essentially Indian, not when
frenzied, but only when she expresses in verse the inner
secrets of the joy and the pathos of her imaginative communion
with past and contemporary Nature in Canada,—when
she sings, with free and infectious lilt, outdoor life
in Canada or impressionistically paints Canadian woods,
skies, plains, snow, waters, or apostrophizes and humanizes
the creatures and objects of nature as if they had a psychology
of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the world knows Pauline Johnson’s lilting and infectious
lyric of Canadian outdoor life, <span class='it'>The Song My
Paddle Sings</span>. It is unsurpassed for suggested or ideated
sensations of wind and stream, of the spirit of motion, of
free life in the open, and wins one both by its vivid pictures
of outdoor life and by its simple but musical <span class='it'>abandon</span>. After
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
a two-stanza apostrophe to the West wind, closing with</p>

<p class='line0'>On either side of the current swift.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Specially to be noted in this poem is the descriptive and
musical realism which the poet effects by a sort of refrain
in the third line of each stanza, a monosyllabic accent which
precisely conveys to the sensibility the actual sensations experienced
in canoeing through slow-moving and rushing
or weltering waters—‘drift, drift,’ ‘dip, dip,’ ‘swirl, swirl,’
‘dash, dash,’ ‘reel, reel,’ ‘sway, sway,’ ‘swings, swings.’ This
is supreme in descriptive and imitative naturalism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For examples of Pauline Johnson’s poetic power to
humanize objects and creatures in Nature <span class='it'>The Sleeping
Giant</span> and <span class='it'>The Homing Bee</span> may be cited. The latter is
also notably suffused with delicate color, moves with
a light, tripping music, and is dainty in structure, thus
exemplifying several of the other qualities of her art. The
opening lines indicate the ‘key’ in music and color:—</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When feasting is done.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>In the Canadian idyll, Pauline Johnson displayed a
delicate sense of color values, and sang as well of airy things
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
in Nature with an airy music, sometimes touched with a
reflective melancholy, as, for instance, in <span class='it'>Shadow River</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tones of melancholy, of sadness, observed sometimes
in Pauline Johnson’s poetry were not all born of a
mystical yearning for union with Nature. Sometimes they
were the expression of a poignant sense of the defeat of
romantic love. Hers was a simple, warm or passionate,
confiding, sensitive, but strong nature; and sensitive and
passionate but strong natures, if they belong to poets, tend
to express poignantly, rather than bitterly, any spiritual
cataclysm in their lives, and, for solace or support, to turn
to Nature or to religion. It was so with Pauline Johnson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles Mair, author of <span class='it'>Dreamland and Other Poems</span>,
and <span class='it'>Tecumseh: A Drama</span>, is the authority for the belief
that Pauline Johnson went through an experience of romantic
love which, in its joy, gave wings of ecstasy and
a warm emotional coloring to her nature-poetry, but which,
when her love suffered a defeat that meant a spiritual
cataclysm for her, drew from her the most poignant expression
of yearning for union with Immortal Love. The
important truth is that whichever emotion she expresses,
she remains unequalled as a lyrist of the ecstasy and the
pathos of romantic love. But her poems of the ecstasy of
love are never merely the expression of subjective emotions.
They also have an idyllic or nature setting which so colors
her nature-poetry itself with the passion of love as to distinguish
it, both as nature-poetry and as love poetry, from
anything else of the kind in Canadian Literature. The
ecstasy is somewhat subdued in <span class='it'>Idlers</span>; but is passionate and
transporting, warmly colored with the light and tints of
Nature, and set to verbal music in perfect harmony with
the emotion and the nature-setting in <span class='it'>Wave-won</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact of the defeat of love, in Pauline Johnson’s
case, may be observed in her <span class='it'>Overlooked</span>, a poem which
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
is notable for the invention on her part of a metaphor that,
for originality and beauty, is worthy of the Greek idyllists
or of Catullus, namely:—</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>At length Pauline Johnson’s merely human passion of
yearning for union with the mortal companion is transmuted
into a spiritualized yearning—which, however, has
not in it the sad wistfulness of the poetry of Marjorie Pickthall—for
union with Immortal Love. Defeat of romantic
love in Pauline Johnson’s case passed, first, into renouncement,
and, at last, into resignation and the total giving of
self to Immortal Love, as in <span class='it'>Brier</span>—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pauline Johnson possessed extraordinary, if not quite
unique, gifts as a story-telling balladist. Examples of her
art in this species are her compelling story of Indian love
and revenge, <span class='it'>Ojistoh</span>, her melodramatic Indian tale, <span class='it'>The
Cattle Thief</span>, and her <span class='it'>Wolverine</span>, a poem of Western
<span class='it'>chevalerie</span>, in which species, however, she does not rank with
Isabella Valancy Crawford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her poetry of the development of the Canadian national
spirit and civilization, by which she marks a broadening in
her own spiritual vision, is notably exemplified in two
poems, <span class='it'>The Riders of the Plains</span> and <span class='it'>Prairie Greyhounds</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
In the former, however, she is more British than Canadian.
But she is Canadian in her <span class='it'>Prairie Greyhounds</span>. In this
poem she achieves an extraordinary virility of rhythm,
employs apt and dramatic epithets and fills the picture with
a vivid suggestiveness of the vastness of Canada and the
vision of the greater autonomous and powerful Dominion
that is to be. <span class='it'>Prairie Greyhounds</span>, moreover, is a supreme
achievement in suggested or ideated sensations of motion.
The reader feels himself as if actually aboard the west-bound
and east-bound Canadian Pacific trains, experiencing,
as does a living passenger on a ‘fast express,’ the
swish, and roar, and onward rush of the trains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a verbal musician Pauline Johnson must be given
a very high place amongst Canadian poets. There is an
avian <span class='it'>abandon</span> and ecstasy, an avian lilt and warbling, in
<span class='it'>The Birds’ Lullaby</span> and in <span class='it'>The Songster</span>. There are flowing
rhythm and haunting melody of rhyme, vowel-harmony,
alliteration and cadences in <span class='it'>The Trail to Lillooet</span>:—</p>

<p class='line0'>Down its rocky-throated canon, sings its golden-throated song.</p>

<p class='line0'>About whose golden setting sweeps the trail to Lillooet.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Pauline Johnson has also achieved what may be noted
in literary history as the first strictly Canadian ‘cradle-song’—Canadian
in music and in setting—her <span class='it'>Lullaby of
the Iroquois</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a nature-colorist and etcher Pauline Johnson again
must be given a very high place. For a <span class='it'>genre</span> etching of
the human figure against a background of nature her <span class='it'>Joe</span>,
which she herself sub-titles ‘An Etching,’ is as vividly presented
and as fetching as a <span class='it'>genre</span> drawing by Murillo. Her
<span class='it'>Lady Lorgnette</span> is as daintily graphic and colorful and
piquant and romantic as anything done by the brush of
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
Romney or Gainsborough or by the later modern ‘society’
miniaturists. She had the pictorial artist’s eye to spy out
a picture in Nature, as in <span class='it'>At Husking Time</span>. She had the
impressionist’s mastery of sensuous pigmentation, as in
<span class='it'>Under Canvas</span>. She could make a picture low-keyed, full
of shadows and suggested sensations and mystery, as in
<span class='it'>Nocturne</span> and in <span class='it'>Moonset</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally: Pauline Johnson is certainly not surpassed,
if equalled, by any other Canadian lyrist as an inventor of
beautiful color epithets and of picturesque, vivid, and compelling
metaphors. They are to be found everywhere in
her poetry. Consider these as examples—‘Russet needles
as censers swing to an altar,’ ‘The sea-weeds cling with
flesh-like fingers,’ ‘Beaten gold that clung like coils of
kisses love inlaid,’ ‘The brownish hills with needles green
and gold,’ ‘O Love, thou wanderer from Paradise,’ ‘Swept
beneath a shore of shade, beneath a velvet moon,’ ‘Like
net work threads of fire,’ and this,</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a woman Pauline Johnson was a rare and beautiful
spirit. As a poet she was of all Canadian poets the most
pervasively true to her Canadian origin and habitat. She
is not to be given always the status of Lampman and Carman
and Duncan Campbell Scott, yet to her unquestionably
belongs a place beside these Canadian singers. Her poetry
had a magic of music and a color of leafy lawns and lovely
grey-eyed and tawny dusks and clear ecstatic morns, which
were all her own. She was indeed a ‘Mohawk Warbler,’

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>t</span> was as a poet, not as a creator of historical romances,
that Sir Gilbert Parker first appeared as a man of letters
and first appealed to the literary public. As a poet he was
appreciated in Australia and in England, but not in Canada.
That as a poet he has been unknown and unappreciated
in his homeland, Canada, is due to the fact that he was
expatriate when he published his two volumes of poems,
the second of which was ‘privately printed,’ and that his
greater reputation as a novelist, particularly of old romantic
Canada, made him known in the Dominion exclusively
as a writer of fiction. Sir Gilbert Parker, however,
ranks high as a sonneteer of spiritual love, and as
lyrist in <span class='it'>genre</span> verse which has attained special reputation,
particularly as texts of songs for <span class='it'>salon</span> and recital repertory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Gilbert Parker was born in Ontario, in 1862. Never
robust, he left Canada in 1886 to seek recovery of health
in the warmer and more salubrious climate of Australia.
While in Australia he began publishing sonnets and lyrics
in magazines. The sonnets were collected and published
in a volume entitled <span class='it'>A Lover’s Diary</span>; first edition, 1894;
second edition, 1898. Before the publication of <span class='it'>A Lover’s
Diary</span> Parker had removed to London. While in England
he privately printed a volume of lyrics entitled <span class='it'>Embers</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
These two volumes, the first revised, and enlarged with
twenty-five sonnets, and the second, with the addition of
other lyrics, were collected and published as Volume 17 of
<span class='it'>The Works of Gilbert Parker</span> (1913). The volume containing
his collected poems is distinguished by a critical
Introduction by Sir Gilbert Parker himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Introduction Parker explains the origin and
theme of <span class='it'>A Lover’s Diary</span>. It is a sonnet-sequence, the
composition of which was begun when the poet was twenty-three
and still resident in Canada. The sequence is a
‘hopeless love, in form of temptation, but lifted away from
ruinous elements by self-renunciation, to end with the inevitable
parting, poignant and permanent, a task of the
soul finished and the toil of the journey of understanding
paid.’ He adds: ‘The six sonnets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. beginning with <span class='it'>The
Bride</span>, and ending with <span class='it'>Annunciation</span>, have nothing to do
with the story further than to show two phases of the
youth’s mind before it was shaken by speculation, plunged
into sadness of doubt and apprehension, and before it had
found the love which was to reveal it to itself, transform
the character, and give a new impulse and direction to
personal forces and individual sense.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a poet of romantic love Parker is concerned with
the spiritual <span class='it'>meaning</span> of it. <span class='it'>A Lover’s Diary</span> is not concerned
with the mere emotions of romantic love but with
its spiritual thrall, and with it as a process of spiritual redemption
and exaltation. As an interpreter of spiritual
love, Parker contrasts with Robert Norwood whose sequence,
<span class='it'>His Lady of the Sonnets</span> (1915), though having
a spiritualizing intent, is highly sensuous and impressionistic
in diction and imagery. Parker breathes a less earthly air.
His sonnet-sequence is addressed more to the imaginative
reason than to the aesthetic imagination. It is much more
mystically conceived and much more chastely lovely with
the ‘white beauty’ of the spirit than is Norwood’s sequence.
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
Both sequences, however, are authentic and noble poetic
creations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In pure beauty of conception, imagery, and artistry,
and in the spiritual exaltation of love, the following sonnet
from Parker’s <span class='it'>A Lover’s Diary</span>, is characteristic of the
whole sequence:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker’s lyrical verse, like his sonnet-sequence, is the
poetry of a young man who still possesses the enthusiasms
of youth for all the lovelier and happier things in existence,
and who rejoices in living. From the text of Parker’s
lyrics it is plain that he had the gifts of a lyrist in the
original Greek meaning, of one who wrote poems to be
<span class='it'>sung</span> to the accompaniment of the lyre. He was gifted
to turn a sentiment either seriously or playfully with simplicity
and directness of diction and with winning musical
lilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, if he had turned to song composition, he was
more ideally equipped to write the texts of poems for songs
than was the greatest of American song composers, the
late Edward MacDowell, who, for lack of singable lyrical
texts, was compelled to compose his own poems as well
as their musical settings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a spontaneity of lyrical lilt, lyrical verve, in
Parker’s lighter poems, which he composed both in literary
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
English and in ‘Irishy.’ As an example of the musical and
colorful qualities of his lyrics in literary English, the following
poem from <span class='it'>Embers</span> will aptly serve:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a composer of song texts, Parker is rivalled only by
his Canadian compatriot, Arthur Stringer, whose poems in
‘Irishy’ have been most winningly and humorously set to
music by their compatriot, Gena Branscombe (Mrs. J. F.
Tenney). It is indeed as a poet, whose lyrics are inevitable
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
texts for songs which have literary charm and simple
humanity that Sir Gilbert Parker has been most admired
and appreciated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this view we have the authority of Sir Gilbert himself.
In the Introduction to the volume of his poetry in
his Collected Works, he says: ‘<span class='it'>Mary Callaghan and Me</span> has
been set to music by Mr. Max Muller, and has made many
friends, and <span class='it'>The Crowning</span> was the Coronation ode of <span class='it'>The
People</span>, which gave a prize, too ample I think, for the best
musical setting of the lines. Many of the other pieces in
<span class='it'>Embers</span> have been set to music by distinguished composers,
like Sir Edward Elgar, who has made a song-cycle of
several, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Mr. Arthur Foote, Mrs.
Amy Woodforde Finden, Robert Somerville, and others.
The first to have musical setting was <span class='it'>You’ll Travel Far and
Wide</span>, to which in 1895 Mr. Arthur Foote gave fame as
<span class='it'>An Irish Folk Song</span>. Like <span class='it'>O Flower of All the World</span>,
by Mrs. Amy Woolforde Finden, it has had a world of
admirers, and such singers as Mrs. Henschel helped to
make Mr. Foote’s music loved by thousands, and conferred
something more than an ephemeral acceptance of the
author’s words.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both, then, as a poet of mystical vision and sublimated
emotion, and of human sentiment and instincts which add
to the humanity and gaiety of life, Sir Gilbert Parker appears
as a poet who has authentic creative gifts and who
is a master craftsman in the ‘art’ of verse. In novelty and
variety his sonnets and lyrics have significantly enhanced
the quality of Canadian poetry, and have in their own degree
and way given the work of the poets of the Systematic
School and Period the character of a genuine ‘renaissance.’</p>

<hr class='tbk112'/>

<p class='pindent'>Another poet who rightfully belongs to the Systematic
School and Period of Canadian Literature is Frederick
George Scott. In 1888, or in the year following the publication
of Roberts’ <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span> (1887), Canon Scott
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
published his first book of verse, <span class='it'>The Soul’s Quest and
Other Poems</span>. This volume was succeeded by five other
volumes of verse, up to 1907, in which year he published
<span class='it'>The Key of Life: A Mystery Play</span>. In 1910 appeared his
<span class='it'>Collected Poems</span>. During the World War he published a
booklet of war verse, <span class='it'>In the Battle Silences</span> (1916).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The forms and qualities of Canon Scott’s poetry were
determined by his own moral personality and by his conception
of the ‘end’ of poetry. It is a fact that in no other
verse written by a Canadian is there such an absolute
identification of the man and the poet as in the poetry of
Canon Scott. The poetry reflects the whole personality of
the man. In the world, Canon Scott is a distinguished
example of the ‘Christian gentleman’—‘a man of liberal
culture and wide sympathies whose life has thrilled with
the larger life, political, social, and religious, a man of
strong courage born of reverent unquestioning faith.’ To
Canon Scott, therefore, the aim of poetry is not ‘art for
art’s sake,’ but the inspiration and consolation of the people
in their hour of doubt or darkness. His conception of the
‘end’ determined the forms and manner of Canon Scott’s
poetry. For if, like the ancient Hebraic poets, he was to
inspire and console his people, he must present his thoughts
in simple forms and in diction and imagery readily understood
by the people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canon Scott stands out from the rest of the members of
the Systematic School and Period as <span class='it'>par excellence</span> the
Poet of the Spirit; and his verse is distinguished from the
bulk of the verse of his colleagues in the Systematic School
as the Poetry of Faith and Consolation. There is nothing
original and distinctive in his forms: they are traditional
and simple. There is nothing original and distinctive
in his message: it, too, is traditional and simple—a
message of faith and courage and of joy in existence.
His distinction is in his ‘art,’ his power to convey
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
beautifully, sweetly—and above all, convincingly—to
the human soul noble or profound thoughts for its sustenance,
refreshment, and consolation. But while the
ethical and spiritual ‘notes’—which must be distinguished
from didacticism—are supreme in his poetry, Canon Scott
is also solicitous about the craftsmanship in his verse.
Though his verse forms are thoroughly socialized and
though he never aims to be a ‘word virtuoso,’ nevertheless
he is always the ‘artist’ in verse technique.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief qualities of Canon Scott’s poetry are piquant
phantasy rather than imagination, ingenious imagery, sympathy
with his kind, tenderness, wistfulness, simple or profound
thought expressed in simple diction and in simple
but dulcet verbal melody. Also in his verse is a two-fold
<span class='it'>Canadianism</span>. The self-reliant faith and courage in it is
Canadian, and the color and the naturalistic imagery are
derived from the woods, and fields, and streams, and hills
of his Canadian homeland, more particularly from Nature
in the Laurentian district. Indeed, Canon Scott has been
given the sobriquet of ‘the Poet of the Laurentians.’ But
while he impregnates and suffuses his verse with color and
naturalistic imagery from Nature in the Laurentians, he
always transmutes his naturalistic perceptions into spiritual
imagery and import. He does not do this with bald and
stark didacticism, but with exquisite artistry, and yet with
an intimacy, apt felicity, and naturalness that make it all
an achievement in winning a reader to see the beauty and
dignity of the familiar and commonplace in Nature. Canon
Scott’s poetry, in a phrase, is the acme of <span class='it'>spiritual realism</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of his diction, rhythm, and melody, and his Canadian
imagery in verse, Scott’s <span class='it'>Dawn</span> furnishes a short and impressive
example:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>How lowly, and yet how beautiful and compelling, are
these figures in the first stanza of that poem—‘pastured with
the stars,’ ‘meadow-lands of space.’ But both are derived
from Canon Scott’s boyhood days in his homeland. They
are Canadian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a Wordsworthian humanity in his poem <span class='it'>The
Cripple</span>, a sympathy with his kind and a tender wistfulness
in his <span class='it'>Van Elsen</span>. There is nobility of thought in his
<span class='it'>Samson</span>, and in <span class='it'>Thor</span>, and a grandeur of vision in his
<span class='it'>Hymn of Empire</span>, which is a Canadian imperial and
patriotic poem in a kind by itself. But in one poem—a
sonnet—Canon Scott has achieved what is perhaps the most
ingenious imagery in Canadian poetry, and one of the
most extraordinary in English literature. This is his sonnet
<span class='it'>Time</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far as derivative influences may in general be observed
in the poets of the Systematic School and Period
of Canadian Literature, Roberts, Lampman, and Carman
are Hellenistic and impressionistic in feeling and thought.
They were devoted to creating poetry that would delight
the aesthetic senses and sensibilities. But Frederick George
Scott is Hebraic in feeling and thought. He created
poetry to satisfy the heart and the religious imagination,
and to sustain and console the human spirit in its sojourn
on earth. He achieved these ends simply yet beautifully.
His poetry is pervaded with the most elemental and enduring
‘heart’ qualities. They give it such a direct and compelling
human appeal as to win a significant and distinctive
place for it in the authentic native and national poetry of
Canada.</p>

<h3>Minor Poets</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE TERM ‘MINOR’ DEFINED—ETHELWYN WETHERALD—JEAN

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>t</span> is proper to distinguish Roberts, Lampman, Carman,
Campbell, Duncan Campbell Scott, Frederick George
Scott, and Pauline Johnson as the ‘major’ poets of the First
Renaissance in Canadian Literature. Though of necessity
with them the writing of verse was in a sense an avocation,
in another sense it was a vocation. They were systematic
both in the writing and the quantitative publishing of it.
Contemporary with them, but, for the most part, later in
production and publishing, were other poets who wrote
with beauty and distinction in poetic style. They followed
the aesthetic and artistic ideals of the ‘major’ poets, but
they were not as systematic as Roberts and his <span class='it'>confrères</span>
in writing or in quantitative publishing. These are denoted
in this work the ‘minor’ poets of the Systematic School
or Period. But nothing invidious as to quality of verse
is intended by the distinction. For a few of these so-called
‘minor’ poets of the Systematic Period wrote some poetry
as fine in aesthetic substance and artistic finish as the poetry
of Roberts and his colleagues. The term ‘minor’ is meant
to distinguish these poets as being, first, <span class='it'>later</span>, for the most
part, than Roberts and his <span class='it'>confrères</span>, and as being, secondly,
<span class='it'>less eminent</span> than the early systematic group of Canadian
poets. The number of these so-called minor or later poets
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
is legion. They ‘flourished’ from 1887 to 1907, or from
the publication of Roberts’ <span class='it'>In Divers Tones</span> to the appearance
of Robert Service’s <span class='it'>Songs of a Sourdough</span> (the beginning
of the Decadent Interim). Detailed appreciation
of the minor poets of the Systematic Period would, therefore,
require a volume by itself. Here we may only recall
the salient names, and specially remark the verse, of some
of the minor poets whose lyrical poetry is particularly
representative or noteworthy, or has become genuinely
popular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Worthy of a place beside the major poets of the Systematic
Period is Ethelwyn Wetherald. In 1895 she published
<span class='it'>The House of the Trees and Other Poems</span>; in 1902, <span class='it'>Tangled
in the Stars</span>; in 1904, <span class='it'>The Radiant Road</span> and in 1907,
an edition of her collected poems, <span class='it'>The Last Robin</span>; <span class='it'>Lyrics
and Sonnets</span>. Perhaps the outstanding aesthetic quality
of her poetry is a tender, subdued, melancholy, spiritual
grace, ‘a grey-eyed loveliness,’ which undoubtedly derives
from the characteristic pensiveness of her Quaker ancestry.
But in all her verse, which is authentic poetry, she discloses
pretty sentiment, reflective beauty, ingenious imagery, and
fine craftsmanship. <span class='it'>The Hay Field</span>, which is Canadian in
inspiration, setting, and color is an apt example of Ethelwyn
Wetherald’s art:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>A poet who has won a distinct and fixed place in the
popular heart and imagination of Canadians is Jean Blewett.
Her first volume, <span class='it'>Heart Songs</span>, appeared in 1897 and immediately
won a wide popularity. This was increased by
her next volume, <span class='it'>The Cornflower and Other Poems</span>
(1906). Her Collected Poems were published in 1922. Jean
Blewett is essentially a ‘woman’s poet.’ By this is meant
that she appeals to the domestic heart and the imagination,
that she sings of the joys of home, the ways of children,
the love of husband and wife. But Jean Blewett does this
in an extraordinary way. She treats homely subjects indeed,
but while she treats them in a homely or rather home-like
way she does it with a simple and ingratiating sincerity
and charm of sentiment and artistry which are quite her
own and in the employment of which she is alone in Canada.
If her poems deal with homely subjects, her artistry is by
no means bourgeois. She rises and falls with the inherent
dignity of her subject. But her human treatment of a
homely subject never issues in vulgarity, or vivid ‘vaudeville’
verse. As an example of her genuine artistry and
dignity of treatment in a high or serious subject we quote
her <span class='it'>Quebec</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jean Blewett is chiefly loved by the people for her <span class='it'>forte</span>—her
sincere, simple singing of true love and faith, of
childhood, and the field flowers, and the joys of the Canadian
Spring and Winter. But, as a <span class='it'>genre</span> poet, she is
gifted with a whimsical humor which is quite unique in the
poetic literature of Canada. <span class='it'>For He was Scotch and So
Was She</span> is a fetching example of Jean Blewett’s humor
and humorous treatment of a simple or homely subject and

<p class='pindent'>Francis Sherman, one of the truest and most individual
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
poets that Canada has produced, is a relative of Charles G.
D. Roberts and Bliss Carman. His literary output has been
meagre, comprising only one regularly published volume,
a small, thin booklet, <span class='it'>Matins</span> (1896), and three or four
privately printed pamphlets of verse. But the quality is
sufficient to fix his place in the company of the authentic
Canadian poets of the First Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sherman’s poetry shows a distinct tendency to mysticism.
He was, evidently, influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite
School. But he had an independent individuality. He
possessed, as a poet, eyes and feelings of his own; and
could express what he saw and felt, with ready and confident
artistry. The Pre-Raphaelite influence on Francis
Sherman and his own natural gifts for individual expression
are disclosed in <span class='it'>Between the Battles</span> (from <span class='it'>Matins</span>):—</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rare spirit and exquisite craftsman, as a poet, is
Albert Ernest Stafford Smythe. He was born in Ireland
in 1861. He is Keltic through and through; and because
he is Keltic in his reactions to the universe, in his perceptions
of spiritual meanings in all things, he divines God
in men and God in Nature, or God <span class='it'>as</span> man and God as
Nature—spiritual presences everywhere. In a word, Albert
E. S. Smythe exemplifies in his genius and art, as
notably and profoundly as Lampman in his, but in a different
way, what Wordsworth called <span class='it'>natural piety</span>. Smythe’s
spiritual perceptions of divinity everywhere rise to a refined
mysticism which he expresses with a ‘white beauty’
in exquisitely finished verse. As contrasted with other
Canadian mystical poets Smythe is the poet of the <span class='it'>Cosmic</span>
Spirit and Beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1891 he published <span class='it'>Poems; Grave and Gay</span>, and in
1923, <span class='it'>The Garden of the Sun</span>. A sonnet (<span class='it'>The Seasons of
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
the Gods</span>) and a lyric (<span class='it'>Anastasis</span>) from the second volume
suffice to disclose his qualities in his role as the poet of the
Cosmic Spirit and Beauty. As a sonneteer, Smythe is not
surpassed by any of his older or younger contemporaries.
<span class='it'>The Seasons of the Gods</span> is lofty in conception, noble in
thought, rich in naturalistic imagery, dulcet in verbal
melody, and perfect in formal artistry. It is music of a

<p class='pindent'>The number of women poets in the period under review
is noteworthy. Along with Ethelwyn Wetherald and Jean
Blewett must be mentioned appreciatively the names and
poetry of Virna Sheard, Helena Coleman, Elizabeth Roberts
MacDonald (sister of C. G. D. Roberts), Helen M.
Merrill, Annie Campbell Huestis, Agnes Maule Machar
(<span class='it'>pseud.</span> ‘Fidelis’), Isabel Ecclestone Mackay, Alma Frances
McCollum, and S. Frances Harrison (<span class='it'>pseud.</span> ‘Seranus’).
Their outstanding contemporaries amongst the men were
Arthur Stringer and Peter McArthur. It is impossible to
review in detail the poetry of all these lyrists. They followed
the ideals of the older systematic group as regards
original inspiration and artistic craftsmanship. But the
work of some of them may briefly be remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1891 S. Frances Harrison published <span class='it'>Pine, Rose, and
Fleur de Lis</span>, a volume of really poetical verse. She is,
however, more to be noted as the compiler of the first
noteworthy anthology of Canadian verse (<span class='it'>A Canadian
Birthday Book</span>, 1887), which is distinguished by the fact
that it contains a poem by the Indian Chief Tecumseh, the
first French-Canadian poem, and some of the earliest
poems of Bliss Carman (a series of quatrains). Arthur
Stringer is a lyrical poet and a poetic dramatist. His art
in the latter respect is appreciated in another chapter. In
1907 he published <span class='it'>The Woman in the Rain and Other
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
Poems</span>, and in 1911, <span class='it'>Irish Poems</span>. His lyrical poetry in
general is distinguished by a warm humanity and by careful
craftsmanship. But he achieved a special distinction
with his poems in ‘Irishy.’ Many of them have been set to
music, and, amongst Canadian-born poets, his only rival
in that field is Sir Gilbert Parker. By themselves Stringer’s
poems in ‘Irishy’ are a novel and real, if not important,
contribution to the <span class='it'>genre</span> and humorous poetry of Canada.
In 1907 Peter McArthur (‘The Sage of Ekfrid’)
published <span class='it'>The Prodigal and Other Poems</span>. He is never a
mere aesthete in form, but he is a rare Nature and humorous
poet—with the lightest and happiest touch in both
departments, as in his <span class='it'>Corn-Planting</span> and in <span class='it'>To the Birds</span>.
He humanizes Nature in a way altogether different from
other Canadian poets, perhaps whimsically but always with
an intimate, colloquial quality of diction, and a piquancy
which makes his Nature poetry spiritually refreshing, even
to formalists and dilettanti.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Properly Isabel Ecclestone Mackay belongs to the minor
poets of the Systematic Period. For in 1904 she published
her first volume of verse, <span class='it'>Between the Lights</span>. But with
that, she turned to writing fiction, and did not publish any
books of verse till the appearance of <span class='it'>The Shining Ship and
Other Poems</span> (1919) and <span class='it'>Fires of Driftwood</span> (1923). Her
first venture in verse was not better than passable or than
good journalistic verse. But in <span class='it'>Fires of Driftwood</span> she
disclosed a real mastery of form, color, and music, along
with a spiritual sentiment which is new in Canadian poetry.
She is occupied most with the vicissitudes and meaning of
life, but occasionally she paints objective Nature with winning
color and music. It is, however, in her poetry <span class='it'>of</span>
childhood (rather than <span class='it'>for</span> children), as in <span class='it'>The Shining
Ship</span>, that Isabel Ecclestone Mackay most displays original
genius and has achieved genuine distinction. The poems
in <span class='it'>The Shining Ship</span> are marked by the rarest of psychological
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
gifts in a poet—insight into the real heart and mind
and imagination of children, and by a diction and phrasing
which appeal to the child mind as immediately and as
winningly as do the child poems of Eugene Field and R.
L. Stevenson. In fact, as Stevenson’s <span class='it'>A Child’s Garden
of Verse</span> is to English Literature, so Isabel Ecclestone
Mackay’s <span class='it'>A Shining Ship and Other Poems</span> is to Canadian
Literature.</p>

<h3>Elegiac Monodists</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>THE ELEGIAC MONODISTS OF CANADA—CHARLES G. D.
ROBERTS—BLISS CARMAN—WILFRED CAMPBELL—DUNCAN
CAMPBELL SCOTT—WILLIAM MARSHALL—JAMES DE MILLE.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>C</span><span class='sc'>anadian</span> Literature is rich—not relatively but absolutely—in
Dirges, Epicedes, Elegies, Threnodies, and
Elegiac Monodies. That Canadian Elegiac Monodies, or
long ‘In Memoriam’ poems inspired by the death of a real,
not a mythical or imagined, person, have genuine distinction,
is indisputable. In number they equal the monodies
of English Literature; and in manner, in variety of form,
and in several qualitative excellences they surpass the
monodies of American Literature. Modern English literature
possesses five great threnodies or monodies; Milton’s
<span class='it'>Lycidas</span>, Shelley’s <span class='it'>Adonais</span>, Tennyson’s <span class='it'>In Memoriam</span>,
Arnold’s <span class='it'>Thyrsis</span>, and Swinburne’s <span class='it'>Ave atque Vale</span>. American
Literature has to its credit two fine and noble monodies:
Emerson’s <span class='it'>Threnody</span> (for his son) and Whitman’s
<span class='it'>When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d</span> (for Lincoln).
Canadian Literature boasts of six threnodies or monodies,
which all enhance New World Literature and at least
two of which are a distinct contribution to the elegiac
poetry of English Literature. The Canadian monodies are
Roberts’ <span class='it'>Ave!</span> (to Shelley), Carman’s <span class='it'>A Seamark</span> (to
Stevenson), Campbell’s <span class='it'>Bereavement of the Fields</span> (to
Lampman), Duncan Campbell Scott’s <span class='it'>Lines in Memory of
Edmund Morris</span> (a Canadian painter), William E. Marshall’s
<span class='it'>Brookfield</span> (to R. R. MacLeod), and James De
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
Mille’s <span class='it'>Behind the Veil</span> (which is sort of Dantean ‘Vision’
of the Beloved in Heaven).</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Canadian poets should have essayed the Elegiac
Monody and have excelled in it is consistent with the
genuine, the essential mood, the spiritual attitudes of the
Canadian people. For while the literary traditions, forms,
and methods of Canadian poets are English, the bases of
Canadian culture and civilization are much more New
England and Scots than English, or, in short, Puritan and
Calvinistic. It was as natural for the 19th century native-born
Canadian, as it was for an 18th century New England
Puritan and Loyalist and a Scots Calvinist, to be preoccupied
with thoughts of ‘otherworldliness.’ The meaning
of life and death is almost a <span class='it'>congenial</span> subject of reflection
to the characteristic Canadian. Fortunately the
<span class='it'>habitat</span> of the Canadian mind, Nature in Canada, recalled
Canadian poets from exclusive occupation with spiritual
prosperities and great departures to thoughts of ‘the soul’s
inherent high magnificence’ in daily mundane life and to
the joys, consolations, spiritual transports, and peace which
Nature affords the distracted human spirit. Another factor
saved Canadian poets from moralistic preachments when
they were moved to express in verse their sorrow over
some great departure. They had the example of the form
and color of the English elegies, from Milton to Swinburne,
to save them from chill gravity and barren moralism. The
Canadian monodists, on their own account, also loved fine
technic in verse, and strove to achieve it according to their
capacity. It was therefore natural that Canadian poets not
only should essay the elegiac monody but also write that
species of poetry with genuine distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subjects of all Canadian elegiac monodies are either
presented against a background of Nature or are suffused
with ‘the color of life’ and the beauty of Nature. The
first, and in many ways the noblest, Canadian monody is
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
Charles G. D. Roberts’ <span class='it'>Ave!</span> (sub-titled <span class='it'>An Ode for the
Centenary of Shelley’s Birth</span>). It is a poem of thirty-one
ten-line stanzas, in decasyllabics, closing with a rimed
couplet, iambic pentameter. The poem is not so much, as
Roberts called it, an ‘ode’ as an elegiac monody, with the
subject presented against a pastoral background. That it
was written ostensibly to commemorate Shelley’s birth, not
his death, must not cause us to conceive the poem as other
than an elegy. The centenary of Shelley’s birth occurred in
1892, when Roberts was 32 years of age. Naturally he
seized the opportunity to memorialize in verse the spirit
of one of his masters, but he also laments the passing of
Shelley and his influence, after the manner of the true
elegiac monody. The poem divides not strophically but
symphonically. The first theme is a picture of the naturalistic
beauties of the Tantramar marshes and the tides that
rush in over it from the Bay of Fundy, and the influences
that Nature about Tantramar had on Roberts as a poet.
He develops this theme by marking how ‘strangely akin’
Tantramar’s marshes seem</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few stanzas are devoted, as they say in symphonic
music, to the ‘working out’ of this similitude in all its
aspects. Then in stanza XXII Roberts formally announces
the elegiac theme as such:—</p>

<p class='line0'>Resounds the ebb with destiny in its roar.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It was remarked, in a preceding chapter, that we miss
the ethical note in Roberts’ genius and poetry. Here is
the exception. In his <span class='it'>Ave!</span> he became morally or religiously,
as well as imaginatively, sublimated. In that poem
he treats life and death with the moral beauty and significance
of his exemplars and models, Shelley’s <span class='it'>Adonais</span>,
Arnold’s <span class='it'>Thyrsis</span>, and Swinburne’s <span class='it'>Ave atque Vale</span>. In
form and substance Roberts’ <span class='it'>Ave!</span> is a true elegiac monody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But is it a great poem? Fault has been found with it
on the side of structure or coherency. The poem appears
coherent when it is remembered that the structure is symphonic
rather than strophic. For though the poem begins
with a Canadian setting, which on the face of it is as far
away as possible from Shelley and Shelley’s England where
he was born and the Italy where he died, it is the thought
of the Canadian marshes and the floods and unrest of the
tides that suggests to Roberts the inner spirit and genius and
life and death of Shelley. So that naturally Roberts passes
from the Canadian setting and its suggestions to the subject
proper of his poem, namely, Shelley; then to memorializing
Shelley’s genius and lamenting his passing, and,
finally, back to the Canadian setting which suggested the
whole poem. Surely that is coherent logic, unity in variety
of structure!
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor is there any real contradiction between the diction
and imagery of the poem and the high magnificence of
the soul which the poem commemorates. The ‘properties,’
of course, are not classical—heroes and nymphs, and all
the mythical personages of the Greek pastoral poets. There
is genuine spiritual dignity in the Canadian setting of the
<span class='it'>Ave!</span>—the atmosphere and color of the grassy Canadian
flatlands, and tides, and mists, and air, and life, and sky.
The poem, too, is in the grand manner and is marked by
a spiritual sweep and lyrical eloquence which convey to
the heart and the imagination of the reader the sense of
profound emotion and of sincerity on the part of the poet.
So that, in spite of alleged structural and dictional faults,
Roberts’ <span class='it'>Ave!</span> is distinguished by sensuous beauty and
splendor, by imaginative sweep, by emotional intensity and
moral and spiritual dignity. But above all it is, as a pastoral
elegy or monody, much more Canadian than English.
As such, it is a really fine and distinctive contribution to
Canadian creative literature. If it is not a great poem, it
is a magnificent, compelling, and noble achievement in
great poetry—a poem which surpasses any monody in
American Literature and which indubitably takes an important
status amongst the elegiac monodies of England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1895 Bliss Carman published <span class='it'>A Seamark</span><a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> (sub-titled
<span class='it'>A Threnody for Robert Louis Stevenson</span>). It is a poem
of thirty-eight stanzas in rimed iambic tetrameter. It is
all in the inimitable lyric manner of Carman, and commemorates
Stevenson as ‘the master of the roving kind.’
Altiloquence is never a quality of Carman’s poetry, as it
is of Roberts.’ Subtlety in simplicity is the formula of
Carman’s genius. And he will color all his homely or
simple images with the most apt felicity of phrase and the
most insinuating verbal melody. For this reason, some
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
miss the high spiritual, mystical, and religious note in
poems which are even more sublimated, though less grandiloquent,
than Roberts’ verse. On the face of <span class='it'>A Seamark</span>,
it seems as if Carman, in commemorating the death of
Stevenson ‘as the master of the roving kind,’ composed a
colorful musical lyric, but not a highly spiritualized poem.
How simple or homely, and yet how felicitous and colorful,
are the images in Carman’s musical lines, announcing
the death of Stevenson on the island of Vailima:—</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The hasty reader does not suspect or surmise the deeper
meaning that is to come. But Carman and Stevenson were
kin of mind and heart, and their kinship was a kinship of
the love of searching out the haunts and ways of the joy
and beauty that are on the face and in the heart of Nature.
So that these master rovers are not careless, irresponsible
vagabonds, but are spiritual nomads with a spiritual function
and bent on a divine errand. Thus does Carman
magnify their office:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>What it was given to Carman to discern in the universe
was the eternal meaning of youth and to hear the ever-young
voice of earth singing in the heart of man and in
the earth, in everything, and to be himself the lyric voice
of the world. Stevenson was also such a lyric voice
of earth. Carman, then, does highly spiritualize his subject
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
when he first presents Stevenson in the manner of the outward
aspect by which he was commonly conceived, a restless
loved adventurer, who when he died was laid down,

<p class='pindent'>In form, and in musical, colorful, simple yet subtle,
spiritualization of the meaning and value of men in whom
the lyric spirit of earth is supreme and vocal, there is not
another elegiac monody in English like, or comparable to,
Carman’s <span class='it'>A Seamark</span>. It, too, like Roberts’ <span class='it'>Ave!</span> enhances
both the quality and quantity of the Canadian and the English
elegy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilfred Campbell was a myriad-minded man and had
an inherited Keltic imagination which felt acutely the magic
and mystery of earth and existence. He conceived, most
beautifully and nobly, the passing of Archibald Lampman
not as a bereavement suffered by mere persons but rather
by the great and constant ‘companion’ of Lampman,
namely, Nature. With a peculiar and lovely sense of the
poetic significance of death, Campbell ennobled the spirit
of Lampman, and perpetuated the meaning of his poetry,
in an elegiac monody which bears the felicitous title
<span class='it'>Bereavement of the Fields</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The poem is in a seven-lined pentameter stanza, and
is infused with Canadian Nature-color throughout. The
diction and the structure are simple, and there is no attempt
at sublimated imagination. The poem is rather in the subdued
and gentle manner of Lampman himself. That is to
say, there is a gentle melancholy running through the poem,
but the melancholy is relieved by a simple spiritual beauty
which conveys the rare essence of the spirit of Lampman,
who passed from earth:—</p>

<p class='line0'>Of gentle and imperishable rhyme.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>If poetry can be accepted as literary criticism, then
Campbell has estimated better than the best prose critic the
significance and worth of Lampman as a poet and his place
in the company of the great:—</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Campbell’s threnody is simple, sensuous, and impassioned,
without being impressionistic and rhetorical. It is
a sincere and noble affirmation of the supremacy of the
spirit of beauty in the world, wherein, as Lampman’s exemplar,
Keats, once said, imperishably:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altogether in another form and with a fresh and novel
poetic conception and impressive artistry, Duncan Campbell
Scott wrote his <span class='it'>Lines in Memory of Edmund Morris</span><a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a>.
Scott’s art is singularly informed by a color and beauty
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
derived from his intimate and exquisite appreciation of the
fine arts, especially music and painting. More than any
other Canadian poet, Scott is the ‘artist in words.’ He is
concerned above all things to employ poetic diction and
imagery with the same love of refined expressiveness and
emotional nuance as inspired such musical composers or
tone-painters as Ravel, Debussy, and MacDowell, and such
painters as Constable, Watteau, and Monet. Or to borrow
from musical criticism, Scott loves his performance, his
executant artistry with words and imagery, more than he
loves his poetic ideas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edmund Morris was a Canadian painter and his spirit
perceived in Canadian Nature and in the Indian aborigines
in Canada something which no other painter had perceived
or attempted to envisage. Scott and Morris were companions
and kindred spirits—the one an artist in words;
and the other an artist in pigments. It was natural, then,
that Scott, on the tragic death of his friend, should commemorate
the loss which both the living friend and the
country suffered by the passing of Edmund Morris. But
it was impossible for Scott to write any conventionalized
elegiac monody. Under inner compulsion, he wrote of life
and death with all his original genius for conceiving, as he
phrases his mode of conception,</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scott’s <span class='it'>Lines in Memory of Edmund Morris</span> is in some
respects unique, but particularly in form, and its simple,
intimate, direct address to the spirit. It is not a pastoral
elegy in the third person but a dramatic monologue, or an
epistle in verse from one spirit to another. There is nothing
like it in all English Literature, not even in Browning. But
intimate, even familiar, and colloquial as it is, the poem
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>
is radiant with a ‘white beauty’ of imagery and chaste
artistry. More notably still, it subdues the turbulence of
our souls in the presence of a great loss by death, transports
the imagination to the mount of spiritual vision, refines
faith, sustains hope, and fills the spirit with a serene peace.
It leaves upon us imperishably the inward sense that ‘it is
not death to die’:—</p>

<p class='line0'>So the old world, hanging long in the sun,</p>
<p class='line0'>And deep enriched with effort and with love,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shall, in motions of maturity,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wither and part, and the kernel of it all</p>
<p class='line0'>Escape, a lovely wraith of spirit, to latitudes</p>
<p class='line0'>Where the appearance, throated like a bird,</p>
<p class='line0'>Winged with fire and bodied all with passion,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shall flame with presage, not of tears, but joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through this elegiac monody there is a singularly
sweet humanity and yet in it are heard the constant overtones
of ‘the soul’s inherent high magnificence,’ and the
whole is suffused or informed with the color of Canadian
Nature and character and life. So that the poem is a
novel and important contribution to the elegiac monody
in English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another style and with another but winning effect
upon the heart and the imagination, is William Edward
Marshall’s monody <span class='it'>Brookfield</span>. It is a poem of forty-five
stanzas in the Spenserian form. Structurally viewed, however,
his <span class='it'>Brookfield</span> is considerably an achievement in that
form. Its theme is the heart and mind of a simple man,
a friend of the poet, who taught the poet to love communion
with the simple creatures and the life of Nature, and to
observe in Nature, not the garment, but the very spiritual
presence of God. There is no metaphysic of Nature in
<span class='it'>Brookfield</span>. There is but the apprehension of divinity in
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
the little wild creatures and in the streams and hills, and in
the mists, and in all the varied life of the universal mother.
Marshall’s master was Keats, and while <span class='it'>Brookfield</span> cannot
critically be called an example of sensuous impressionism,
yet it is warmly colored with pigmentation from the palette
of Nature. But the loveliest strands running through the
warp and woof of the poem are those of love and the
heavenly vision. The sweet, gentle, even tender, Nature-quality
as well as the spiritual note in the poem, may be
apprehended from the following stanza:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ah, he was richly dowered of the earth!</p>
<p class='line0'>The grain of sand, the daisy in the sod,</p>
<p class='line0'>Awoke his heart; and early he went forth,</p>
<p class='line0'>Through field and wood, with young eyes all abroad;</p>
<p class='line0'>And saw the nesting birds and beck and nod</p>
<p class='line0'>Of little creatures running wild and free,</p>
<p class='line0'>(Which know not that they know, yet are of God)</p>
<p class='line0'>And kept his youth, and grew in sympathy,</p>
<p class='line0'>And loved his fellows more, and had love’s victory.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Literary critics in the United States, in reviewing Marshall’s
<span class='it'>Brookfield</span> signalized both its sensuous and spiritual
beauty as extraordinary, and in line with the quality of the
best English elegiac monodies. In Canada it received high
praise from Sir Andrew MacPhail, who sponsored it by
publishing it in <span class='it'>The University Magazine</span>, and from Dr.
Archibald MacMechan. ‘No such poem,’ said the latter,
‘has appeared in Canada since Roberts’ <span class='it'>Ave!</span> In dignity
and depth of feeling the <span class='it'>Ave!</span>, De Mille’s <span class='it'>Behind the Veil</span>,
and <span class='it'>Brookfield</span> stand together—a noble trio.’ Marshall’s
<span class='it'>Brookfield</span> is Canadian in subject and setting and is indeed
a beautiful and noble application of ideas to life—a genuinely
original contribution to the creative poetic literature
of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>James De Mille’s <span class='it'>Behind the Veil</span>, published posthumously
in 1892, is a kind of elegiac monody. The poet
himself does not so sub-title it. He designates it simply as
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
‘A Poem.’ Whether the ‘Loved One’ who has been lost to
the poet was a real person or an imagined companion of
the spirit, it is impossible to surmise from the poem. But
the poem itself is concerned with life and death and yearning
for union with the Beloved in Heaven, and is thus a
spiritualized elegy. Essentially, however, it is a reflective
or philosophical poem. If it is reflective, it is also highly
melodramatic both in substance and in form. Part of its
melodramatic quality derives from its metrical structure
which suggests Poe’s <span class='it'>Raven</span>. It is written in stanzas of
five lines in trochaic tetrameter—a form totally unsuited
to its intended high spiritual dignity of theme. A taste of
its quality is afforded from the following stanzas:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is impossible to read one hundred and twenty-five
stanzas or 625 lines like the preceding, in which the feminine
endings make fixed caesural pauses that prevent enjambement
and thus inhibit rhythmical variety, without the
reader’s feeling himself in the realm of the musically melodramatic.
So that the high seriousness of the poem suffers
a loss in impressiveness because of the metre and rhythm
of the poem. It is plain that De Mille was not an adroit
verbal musician. The spiritual dignity and seriousness of
the poem can be commended, but on the whole, it is not
poetry, and is not a significant contribution to the Canadian
monody.</p>

Dog</span>, he led the way in Canadian historical
romance. Major John Richardson had written historical
novels years before, but Richardson’s material was largely
first hand, from contact with a life and with a setting
similar to what he described. We might argue that Kirby
‘discovered’ to the fictionists who were to come after him
the wealth of material that lay in the unknown and almost
forgotten Canadian past, for he founded his work on Canadian
history and infused it with Canadian incident and
color; and although Mrs. Leprohon’s romances had a considerable
vogue both in English and in French, the circulation
of her novels was chiefly local and not anything like
so widespread as that of Kirby’s single masterpiece.
Yet it is problematic just how much the historical or
romantic fiction of the Post-Confederation period (beginning,
say, in 1888) owes to Kirby and how much it owes
to a stirring impulse of nationality. That impulse produced
tangible evidences in our literature because of a
conscious realization of national ideals and a sensing of
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
the spirit of a courageous and romantic past in a country
that, superficially viewed, had barely reached the stage of
‘growing pains.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1888 William Douw Lighthall published <span class='it'>The Young
Seigneur</span>, a socio-political study of life and institutions in
Canada, which according to the author himself; ‘arose out
of my ideas as a young man concerning an ideal of Canadian
nationality to which I gave the color of this province
(Quebec) as I knew it in the old Seigneuries.’ Possibly
the ‘thesis’ overpowered the romantic or novel elements,
for this book is not regarded as equal in literary merit to
its successors. <span class='it'>The False Chevalier</span> (1898) was a historical
romance set partly in Canada and partly in France.
It is an attempt to depict an actual romance found in a
packet of documents at the house of the De Léry’s at
Boucherville near Montreal. It is rich in atmosphere and
color both of the old land and the new and is filled with
engaging incident, but lacks somewhat in effective novel
construction, and in convincing characterization. It is in
<span class='it'>The Master of Life</span> (1910) that Dr. Lighthall has produced
a unique and masterly piece of fiction. With
Hiawatha as its hero, it is purely aboriginal in setting and
color and exhibits the author’s wide knowledge of Indian
history and archaeology. It was the result of Dr. Lighthall’s
sympathies with the Iroquois Indians, derived originally
from the ancient family records of the Schuylers
(from whom the Lighthalls are descended). They, as
leading British officers and statesmen, had much to do with
keeping the Iroquois steadfast to the British Crown. Although
the impetus to its writing originated in this way,
<span class='it'>The Master of Life</span>, in its development is an example of
rare constructive imagination and is pervaded with a richly
poetic interpretation that apprehends nature as filled with
spiritual presences and nature’s beauty as the garment of
the Great Spirit.
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The year 1889 saw the publication of a work of pure
romance in <span class='it'>My Spanish Sailor</span> by (Margaret) Marshall
Saunders. This was a love story of the sea in which a
Nova Scotian girl and a Spanish sea-captain are the leading
characters. Again in <span class='it'>Rose à Charlitte</span> (1898), afterwards
published as <span class='it'>Rose of Acadie</span>, Miss Saunders essays romance,
colored, it is true, by a seemingly historic atmosphere, but
yet rather a record than a history, for the Acadian habits
and customs which one might think of as belonging to a
past age were current among the people in the Bay of St.
Mary settlement when visited by Miss Saunders in the
summer of 1897. Here the descendants of the Acadians
had lived apart from the English and preserved their language,
traditions, customs, and their unique manner of
life. ‘The elements of strength and weakness of the people,
their patient devotion, their openness, simplicity and
generosity, their love of gossip and light-heartedness, with
the shadows of the tragic past brooding over them, are all
caught in a true perspective.’ Thus it is not until the year
1896 that we come upon a truly legitimate successor to <span class='it'>The
Golden Dog</span>. In that year appeared Gilbert Parker’s <span class='it'>Seats
of the Mighty</span>, which became one of the most popular of
his novels. The story has a strong and fairly unified and
coherent plot. It exhibits Parker’s powers of characterization
and presents to us a gallery of vividly limned historic
portraits—Robert Moray, Doltaire, Gabord, De la Darant,
Bigot, Vaudreuil, Montcalm, Wolfe—in the main true to
type, human, and universal. There is not, however, an
unerring accuracy in atmosphere and color and characterization.
The writer was not sufficiently saturated with his
subject and occasional touches of modernity and tinges
of contemporary color subtract from the excellence of
artistry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Parker’s fiction really began with his short stories
of ‘Pretty Pierre’ in 1890. It is related that upon coming
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
to London from Australia he brought to Archibald Forbes,
then noted as a war correspondent, a collection of stories.
Forbes’ comment was: ‘You have the best collection of
titles I ever saw.’ Parker took his manuscripts home and
promptly burned them. A day or so afterwards, while
passing a shop window filled with armor and other curios,
he noticed the leather coat and fur cap of a trapper. He
went at once to his room and began to write <span class='it'>The Patrol of
the Cypress Hills</span>, the first story in the series <span class='it'>Pierre and
His People</span>. These stories dealt with the life of early
Western Canada and were followed from time to time by
other volumes: <span class='it'>A Romany of the Snows</span>, published in England
under the title, <span class='it'>An Adventurer of the North</span>, picturing
French-Canadians in the woods and rural settlements;
<span class='it'>The Lane That Had No Turning</span>, stories of that Quebec
settlement which is the background of the novel <span class='it'>When Valmond
Came to Pontiac</span>; <span class='it'>Cumner’s Son</span>, sketches of life in
the South Seas and in Australia; <span class='it'>Donovan Pasha</span>, tales of
Egypt and the Soudan; <span class='it'>Northern Lights</span>, more modern
stories of Western Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parker became a prolific writer of novels and his settings
range from Canada and the South Seas to England,
Egypt, and South Africa. The treatment varies from an
almost immediate transcript of near present conditions as
in <span class='it'>The Judgment House</span> to the re-creation of the historic
past in <span class='it'>The Battle of the Strong</span>, from the delicate imaginative
romance in <span class='it'>When Valmond Came to Pontiac</span>, to a
pathological study in <span class='it'>The Right of Way</span>; he gives us a combination
of melodrama and mysticism in <span class='it'>The Weavers</span>,
the revealment of innate greatness of character in <span class='it'>The
Translation of a Savage</span>, while in <span class='it'>You Never Know Your
Luck</span>, he cleverly expands a tenuous short story thread to
the full proportions of a novel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides <span class='it'>The Seats of the Mighty</span>, the novels of Gilbert
Parker that will be likely to command most attention because
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>
of intrinsic worth are: <span class='it'>The Right of Way</span>, <span class='it'>The Battle
of the Strong</span>, <span class='it'>When Valmond Came to Pontiac</span>, <span class='it'>The
Weavers</span>, and <span class='it'>The Judgment House</span>. <span class='it'>The Right of Way</span> is
a compelling study in abnormal psychology. There may
be improbabilities in the development of the story of
Charley Steele, but there is a living force in his character
and he stands forth as one of the realities of fiction. <span class='it'>The
Battle of the Strong</span> depicts the Channel Islands in the
eighteenth century, and was written in a mood of defiance.
Parker was going to get away from a Canadian background.
He would write no more novels of Canada. But,
as Sherlock Holmes ‘returned,’ so Canada was too much a
part of Gilbert Parker’s life to remain out of his writings,
and he found, himself unable to get away from it for very
long. <span class='it'>The Battle of the Strong</span>, however, was based on a
thorough and sympathetic study of the country and people
of the Channel Islands and the characters and incidents are
colored with a simple, engaging humor. <span class='it'>When Valmond
Came to Pontiac</span> is a delightful excursion into romance in
which the Napoleonic tradition shows its influence in a little
out-of-the-way village of Quebec. It has much of the
charm of Booth Tarkington’s <span class='it'>Monsieur Beaucaire</span> and is
structurally the nearest to artistic perfection of any of
Parker’s novels. <span class='it'>The Weavers</span> rises to a more Imperialistic
sweep, dealing as it does with internal and international
politics of Egypt, while <span class='it'>The Judgment House</span>, a novel of
London and South Africa, is his greatest literary conception;
in it his imaginative vision has apprehended big
interests, big business, big ideals, big expansion, Imperial
ends, conceived and carried out by big men, struggling
and striving and achieving in a big world. His more
recent novels, although some of them, as <span class='it'>The Money Master</span>,
show considerable skill in characterization, are largely
novels of incident and of accidental circumstance and have
not the broad grasp of men and events nor the innate emotional
depth and power of those just outlined.
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The outstanding qualities of Parker’s work are:—</p>

<hr class='tbk115'/>

<p class='pindent'>(1) The strong dramatic quality. It is no surprise to
us to learn that he was in his college days a most enthusiastic
Shakespeare student and an ‘elocutionist’ of some
reputation. The power to portray dramatic situations
is exhibited in his very earliest writings. One need but
open almost any of his novels and read the first paragraph
to find that one is projected into an imaginative
world of action, although the story may begin with a sentence
of pure narration or description.</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Skill in descriptive characterization. How effectively
action, explanation, and description are combined
to make his characters vivid, cannot be better exhibited
than in the introduction of Valmond in <span class='it'>When Valmond
Came to Pontiac</span>. Yet there is a tendency to cast some
of his characters in moulds, so that they become types
rather than individuals. ‘Donovan Pasha’ is but ‘Pretty
Pierre’ amid new conditions and circumstances. ‘Krool’
of <span class='it'>The Judgment House</span> recalls forcibly ‘Soolsby’ of <span class='it'>The
Weavers</span>.</p>

<hr class='tbk117'/>

<p class='pindent'>(3) His versatility is apparent from the survey already
made of his works. And to the list of poems, short
stories, and novels, might be added his book on the Great
War—<span class='it'>The World in the Crucible</span>—and his articles on agricultural
questions and land settlement.</p>

<hr class='tbk118'/>

<p class='pindent'>(4) His breadth of literary canvas. It may seem a
simple matter to place one part of a story in England and
another in Africa, or part in Canada and another part in
the South Seas, but it requires a very broad grasp of material
and a wide knowledge of people, and a keen sense of
atmosphere to do it effectually. He has been described as
the product of the British Empire, and there is little doubt
that the breadth of his experience is the basis of his breadth
of literary vision.
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span></p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'>(5) A sense of the supernatural and touches of mysticism
are consequent to his strong dramatic powers and
show in many of his short stories, e.g. <span class='it'>The Tall Master</span>
and <span class='it'>The Flood</span> in <span class='it'>Pierre and His People</span>, and in some of
his novels, notably in <span class='it'>The Weavers</span>.</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'>Summing up our impressions of Sir Gilbert Parker, we
find that he has a breadth of vision not excelled or even
equalled by any other Canadian writer. Comparing him
with Norman Duncan, we see that Duncan is a finer workman
but in a narrower range. Parker comes close to taking
a place with the front rank modern British novelists
and yet he does not quite do it. Why? Perhaps because
of the fact that a man’s excellences are very often the
cause of his defects. He is nothing if not dramatic. He
reaches always for the spectacular climax where nature is
often satisfied to take things quietly. He has just a little
too much of a tendency to play to the gallery. He verges
nearer to the melodramatic than do his contemporary British
novelists—in fact, he frequently falls to it. There is
not enough innate value in his incidents, there is more stage
play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet on the whole, Parker’s work is fresher. There is
more of the clear air of the out-of-doors. There is not
the morbidity of tone, nor the feeling of helplessness that
is found in the fiction of Hardy, Meredith, Bennett, Galsworthy,
Philpotts, Trevena and other leaders of the modern
British novelists. We can forgive Parker many lapses because
at the end—the total effect is the feeling that the
good comes uppermost. Take even Pierre, half-breed
gambler, a sort of half-Ishmaelite, yet with a sense of
fair-play, a chivalry, a kindness that never leaves him.
And so nearly all his characters and most of his books
inspire us finally with divine lessons of hope and encouragement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The historical romances of Charles G. D. Roberts—<span class='it'>The
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
Forge in the Forest</span> (1896), <span class='it'>A Sister to Evangeline</span>, <span class='it'>The
Prisoner of Mademoiselle</span>, <span class='it'>The Raid From Beauséjour</span>—while
they are Canadian in setting and color, do not show
the same imaginative reach and the same emotional power
as the romances of Parker. The themes and settings of
Roberts’ romances are rather narrow. They are concerned
chiefly with minor incidents of the early history of Acadia,
or we might say rather with a minor treatment of these
incidents, for the historical episodes about which these
stories are centered were, no doubt, of themselves important
enough to the early French colony. The difficulty is
that, despite the skill of Roberts in depicting local color
and reproducing atmosphere in exquisite smooth flowing
prose, he evinces little gift of characterization and the
personages of the story are more or less mechanical puppets
speaking by the will and with the words of the showman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhat unique in early romantic fiction is <span class='it'>The Forest
of Bourg Marie</span>, by S. Frances Harrison (‘Seranus’), first
published in 1898. The bygone civilization of the old
seigneuries casts its glamor over a newer and more
sophisticated Quebec, in its turn influenced by the hectic
glitter of great cities of ‘the States,’ to which were attracted
restless youth of French-Canada. Thus Mikel Caron,
forest-ranger for the county of Yamachiche, links to the
present the past grandeur of the Seigniory of Bourg Marie,
while Magloire le Caron (Mr. Murray Carson in the
States), villain of the piece, is the hybrid product of three
civilizations. The writer’s style alters itself to harmonize
with the varying spirit and mood of her story—stately and
poetic in its descriptions of departed greatness; nervous and
gauche in the passages where the turbulent current of a
fevered modernity breaks through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>Marguerite de Roberval</span> (1899), T. G. Marquis
turned back to the times of Jacques Cartier and applied
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
his constructive imagination as well as his industry in research
to building a story of Old France and the New
around a most romantic and dramatic love episode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same year appeared <span class='it'>The Span o’ Life</span> written in
collaboration by William MacLennan and Jean N. MacIlwraith.
Its historical basis is found in the memoirs of a
Scottish Chevalier, who shared in the ill-starred rebellion
of Prince Charles and afterwards became a soldier of fortune
in the army of France, thus being present at the siege
of Louisbourg and afterwards escaping to Quebec and
joining the French forces there. The plot element of the
story is somewhat weak and it is of value chiefly for its
inside history of the siege conditions in the two greatest
forts of New France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far the concern of Canadian historical fiction, as we
have seen it, has been chiefly with New France and the conflicts
between the French and English in North America.
It remained for Agnes C. Laut to realize quite independently
the amazing wealth of romantic history that lay back
of the opening up and exploiting of the middle and far
West of Canada. While yet a schoolgirl and knowing only
the formal, conventional, and statistical outlines of Canadian
history as then taught, she came accidentally upon a
copy of Gunn’s <span class='it'>History of Manitoba</span> and sat up all night
thrilled with the story of the Selkirk settlers. Thus originated
the impulse, fulfilled later (1900), in <span class='it'>The Lords of
the North</span> and (1902) in <span class='it'>Heralds of Empire</span>, to reveal
what she felt, to show that Canada’s history was one page
of glory. It had never been told in a way that the youth
of the land would realize this, and she felt that, lacking
this realization, we lacked a truly national spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Lords of the North</span> presents a vivid picture of Canada’s
fur trade at the most flourishing period of that industry.
It follows the conflict between the rival fur companies—the
North-West and the Hudson’s Bay Company. Across
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>
its pages flit the voyageur, the trader, Indians, missionaries,
settlers, buffalo hunters—all the romantic figures of
the Canadian West of the period of 1815 to 1821. <span class='it'>Heralds
of Empire</span> will be remembered for its characterization of
Pierre Radisson, the man of action—the man who dared
and who did—the man with the true pioneer spirit. Miss
Laut’s style is forcible and direct. Her sentences are brief
and crisp. The story runs on without effort. Description
never wearies because it is the natural and necessary setting,
painted with quick, bold vivid strokes. Of the larger matters
of plot structure—the architectonics of fiction, she can
hardly be said to have achieved mastery, but she writes
with such energy and enthusiasm for her subject that in a
measure this defect may be overlooked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilfred Campbell also essayed the historical romance
but with indifferent success. His <span class='it'>Ian of the Orcades</span> with
its historical Scottish setting was more congenial to his
genius than <span class='it'>A Beautiful Rebel</span>. It has arresting incidents,
vigorously drawn characters, and considerable intensity of
emotions, but it wins us rather by Campbell’s power to suffuse
the text with what Matthew Arnold called ‘natural
magic.’ It is more in keeping with the ‘old world imagination’
of Campbell which has been defined in the study of
his poetry. <span class='it'>A Beautiful Rebel</span>, a story of Canada and
the United States in the war of 1812, is lacking in imaginative
color, is defective in structure, and the incident is
too slight for the significance of the theme. The comment
of the author has a way of appearing obtrusively as a
digression, or at times in the mouths of the characters.
What value <span class='it'>A Beautiful Rebel</span> has as historic fiction lies
chiefly in its representation of the part played in the war by
American sympathizers living as Canadian settlers.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>II. The Romancers of Animal Psychology.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>In the field of romance of wild and of domestic animal
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
psychology, Canadian writers have shown a distinct and
unique inventive genius and a corresponding artistry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ernest Thompson Seton attracted the attention of the
world by his romances of wild life in Canada because he
combined in them the skilled observation of the scientist,
the vision of the artist, the insight of the psychologist, the
sympathy of the humane man; and, perhaps, more than all
that, the spirit of youthful wonder at, and interest in,
the ways and doings of the creatures of the field and wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brought to his writings of animal life a new point
of view—namely, that human beings and wild animals are
kin; that animals are motivated with passions and desires
and, to some extent, ideas, just as human beings are. Thus
he wrote with sympathy and with creative imagination and
revealed the new life and being of wild animals, and he
hoped to achieve the practical result of quickening the
sympathies of man toward animals and stopping the
thoughtless extermination of many of our harmless wild
creatures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His books such as <span class='it'>Wild Animals I Have Known</span>
(1898), <span class='it'>The Trail of The Sand-Hill Stag</span>, <span class='it'>The Biography
of a Grizzly</span>, <span class='it'>Lives of the Hunted</span>, are studies of animal
psychology and behavior. <span class='it'>Lives of the Hunted</span>, for example,
contains life-histories of Krag, the mountain Ram;
of Johnny Bear; of Coyotito, the Escaped Coyote. Krag’s
whole history from birth to death is faithfully sketched
and, incidentally, much is learned about the habits of the
mountain-sheep. From these life-histories we gain, not
merely knowledge and information but wisdom, since animal
life and human life are akin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the earlier animal stories were written in
dialogue—the animals being made to talk. But, very wisely,
the author soon adopted the narrative style and removed
his sketches from the character of fairy stories to that of
real interpretations of animal life.
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>Two Little Savages</span> he gives the adventures of two
boys who lived in the woods as Indians and learned much
about Indian life and all kinds of wood-lore. Other stories
of a similar type are employed for the teaching of different
phases of woodcraft. <span class='it'>Wood Myth and Fable</span> advances a
step further and from incidents in animal life, and other
occurrences in nature, the writer points a definite moral
lesson. This escapes preachiness by the adroit epigrammatic
wit of the ‘moral.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>A somewhat different literary ideal inspired Charles
G. D. Roberts to undertake the pure romance of animal
psychology and behavior. ‘It may be that this arose as
a natural development from Roberts’ early attempts to depict
a narrative from actual occurrences and experiences
in the woods. At any rate <span class='it'>Earth’s Enigmas</span> (1896), followed
by numerous other volumes such as <span class='it'>The Kindred of
the Wild</span>, <span class='it'>The Watchers of the Trails</span>, <span class='it'>The Haunters of
the Silences</span>, <span class='it'>Red Fox</span>, <span class='it'>The Feet of the Furtive</span>, <span class='it'>More Animal
Stories</span> have established the place of Roberts as the
supreme artist in the field of animal romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roberts’ treatment of animal psychology differs from
that of Thompson Seton or Marshall Saunders. He makes
his wild animals either wholly human or too human. They
move in their world with a sort of super-animal (or super-human)
knowledge, and Roberts’ discloses a subconscious
motivation of conduct in the wild animals that outdoes the
present clay psycho-analyists in their revealments of human
motivation. For this reason they appeal not to the heart
but to the analytic imagination and the aesthetic sense.
They awaken the interest of the intellect rather than the
sympathetic emotions. They lack humor and pathos, but
in imaginative sweep and artistic structure they are supreme
creations. As examples of a literary prose style
they stand almost alone in their particular field of fiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not all Roberts’ animal stories are of this ‘intellectual’
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
type. Human interest and humor is added by showing
animals in relationships, more or less accidental, to mankind,
in such volumes as <span class='it'>The Backwoodsman</span>, <span class='it'>Hoof and
Claw</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The peculiar <span class='it'>forte</span> of Marshall Saunders is the romance
of the domesticated animal or animal pet. <span class='it'>Beautiful Joe:
The Autobiography of a Dog</span>, first published in 1894, is
one of the literary phenomena of the world. It has been
translated into fourteen or more languages and has sold
over a million copies. With acute perceptive sympathy and
engaging artistry, Miss Saunders has commingled strangely
but veraciously the mind and life of the domestic animals. She
envisages truthfully their ‘near humanity’ and
reveals them as akin to man in feelings, passions, desires,
and the motivation of conduct, but keeps them on a level
below man. Her animals are not human, but they appeal
more to the heart of the humanity in us than those of Roberts,
Thompson Seton, or W. A. Fraser; particularly do
they appeal more to the spirit and heart of youth. Her
<span class='it'>Golden Dicky</span>, the story of a canary and his friends; <span class='it'>Bonnie
Prince Fetlar</span>, the autobiography of a pony, and <span class='it'>Jimmy
Goldcoast</span>, the story of a monkey, have all the engaging
qualities of her earlier work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>W. A. Eraser, in <span class='it'>Mooswa and Others of the Boundaries</span>
(1900), and in <span class='it'>The Outcasts</span> (1901) achieved a distinct
success by working with much the same material as Roberts
and Thompson Seton and to some extent combining the
style and treatment of both. He is not so scientific as
Thompson Seton; nor is he so literary or so psychoanalytic
as Roberts. <span class='it'>The Sa’-Zada Tales</span> (1905) in which
the animals at the zoo are represented as conversing with
their keeper, Sahib Zada, and with one another, exhibit the
intimate knowledge of wild animal life gained, no doubt,
during the author’s residence in Asiatic countries, but they
are not as distinctively original in manner, nor as high in
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
literary quality as his other animal tales. Fraser, however,
has a peculiar field in which he excels—in his novel
<span class='it'>Thoroughbreds</span> (1902), and in his volume of short stories
<span class='it'>Brave Hearts</span> (1904), he shows a sympathetic understanding
of the life of the race horse and he presents vividly and
with sometimes a rollicking humor, at others a tender
pathos, many incidents and expressions of the racing field.
He is an apostle of clean sport and a true lover of the racing
horse and his enthusiasm gives to these stories a directness
and coherence not always found in some of his later
stories and novels with different subjects and settings.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>III. The Evangelical Romance.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>The pioneer writer of the ‘evangelical romance’ in Canada
was ‘Ralph Connor’ (Reverend Charles W. Gordon).
Back of all his books stands the missionary spirit. Indeed
it was that missionary spirit which led to the finding of his
literary gift. The story of that finding dates back to 1896.
He had been attending a meeting of the Home Mission
Committee of the Presbyterian Church at Toronto, and
afterwards tried to impress upon the Rev. J. A. Macdonald,
then editor of <span class='it'>The Westminster</span>, the duty of the magazine
to educate the committee and the people to a greater liberality.
The editor’s reply was: ‘Articles are no good if
they have only facts and statistics and exhortations. Give
me a sketch, a story, a thing of life rather than a report.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of this advice was a series of sketches of
missionary life in the foothills of the Rockies, which were
featured as <span class='it'>Tales of the Selkirks</span> in <span class='it'>The Westminster</span>
(1897) and appeared in book form the following year as
<span class='it'>Black Rock</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the first sketches were ready it was deemed advisable
to conceal the identity of the author. The editor
telegraphed the query, ‘What name?’ The reply came,
‘Sign sketch Cannor.’ ‘Can—Nor, that would betray the
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
face of a mask,’ says the editor. ‘Perhaps the operator
made a mistake. Likely it should be Connor.’ And running
over the alphabet of masculine names, he decided
that ‘Ralph’ would just about fit with ‘Connor.’ Thus the
christening of the missionary novelist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ralph Connor’s novels fall into several groups. <span class='it'>Black
Rock</span> and <span class='it'>The Sky Pilot</span> are tales of the Rocky Mountain
foothills, both telling of the wild life of the West and of
the work of the missionary. <span class='it'>The Man From Glengarry</span>
and <span class='it'>Glengarry School Days</span> deal with the life of the author’s
boyhood in Eastern Ontario. <span class='it'>The Prospector</span> and <span class='it'>The
Doctor</span> combine East and West, by following their leading
characters through the University of Toronto and transferring
them to Western Canada. <span class='it'>The Foreigner</span> has a
Manitoba setting and concerns itself with the problem of
the assimilation of the foreigner. <span class='it'>Corporal Cameron</span> and
<span class='it'>The Patrol of the Sun Dance Trail</span>, carry a young Scot to
Canada and through the ranks of the Mounted Police.
The Great War gave material for <span class='it'>The Major</span>; labor troubles
for <span class='it'>To Him That Hath</span>; while in <span class='it'>The Gaspards of Pine
Croft</span>, the author reverted to a setting not so far from that
of his first novel for a story more emotional and psychological
in nature than his others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The circulation of Ralph Connor’s novels has been
phenomenal and has reached somewhere between two and
a half and three millions, yet it cannot be said that he has
established a reputation as a literary artist. His stories
carry the reader because of action, incident, and tense emotional
situations. They always have an underlying ethical
and spiritual significance and they promulgate a belief in
the presence of some redeeming virtue in every human
being, so that, despite adverse critical opinion, they continue
to touch the responsive chord in the heart of a common
humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of his later works has quite come up to the standard
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
of <span class='it'>Black Rock</span> or <span class='it'>The Sky Pilot</span> in consistency of
characterization and in unity of total effect. Indeed <span class='it'>The
Sky Pilot</span> is the most artistically finished of all his works,
because of the natural coherence of its parts in their development
of the central theme. Dramatic power he has to a
marked degree, so far as the presentation of individual
scenes is concerned, such as the fight in the lumber camp,
the horse race, the barn-raising, and many other thrilling
episodes; but his grasp of dramatic values is not broad
enough to escape melodrama. The constructive dramatic
instinct which weaves each separate incident into a chain
of cause and effect dependent upon the character and
motives of the leading personages of the story is very little
in evidence. Whole chapters might be lifted bodily from
some of these novels without interfering with the main
thread of the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His imagination is reproductive rather than creatively
constructive. The stories of the foothills are built upon
his own missionary experiences at Banff and elsewhere;
the Glengarry tales deal with his schoolboy experiences and
his knowledge of the rough life of the lumber woods and
the drive; the stories of east and west are also drawn from
his own experiences in college and in the missionary field.
As a result of this his characters tend to become types and
although fairly individual and distinctive they are inclined
to act mechanically and to operate without sufficient inherent
motivation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first novel of Robert E. Knowles, <span class='it'>St. Cuthbert’s</span> although
a romance of a Presbyterian congregation, is not
strictly an ‘evangelical novel.’ It has more to do with
showing the Presbyterian Church as an institution which
dominated the life of the Presbyterian community. The
doings of the Kirk session; the relations of the minister
with the various elements of his flock, the pious and the
profligate, are described with rare fidelity. The tender
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
undercurrent covered by Scottish reserve; the sympathetic
understanding of human nature as the greatest and most
essential quality of ministry; the dry, pawky Scottish
humor; the distinctive and consistent characterization—these
elements make <span class='it'>St. Cuthbert’s</span> a piece of genuine literature.
<span class='it'>The Dawn at Shanty Bay</span> is in reality a short story.
There is one underlying motive, and only one, dominating
the whole—it is the fight between parental love and parental
dignity. It should rank as one of the sweetest ‘Christmas
Carols’ in English literature. His remaining novels—<span class='it'>The
Undertow</span>, <span class='it'>The Web of Time</span>, <span class='it'>The Attic Guest</span>, and
<span class='it'>The Singer of the Kootenay</span> are of the evangelical type
and are fashioned much to the same pattern, showing inconsistencies
in development and a lack of structural
unity.</p>

<h3>Short Story Writers</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>THE SHORT STORY FICTIONISTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC SCHOOL—E.
W. THOMSON—DUNCAN CAMPBELL SCOTT—CHARLES
G. D. ROBERTS—GILBERT PARKER—ERNEST THOMPSON
SETON—W. A. FRASER.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>here</span> is, on this continent, a literary tradition that
Edgar Allan Poe is the creator of the short story.
The truth is that Poe applied a new method to the short
narrative or prose tale in that he gave the short story a
higher unity of effect towards an impressionistic climax.
He did not originate or create it; he simply improved its
technique. But with the school of Poe this method crystallized
into a formula, and the so-called American short
story became an invention rather than an imaginative creation.
Thus it depends upon a cumulation of effects rising
to a climactic peak of emotional intensity, or upon a plot
that induces suspense by a clever interplay of incident. Its
processes are for the most part mechanical. The telling
or the reading of a short story of this type is far more a
coldly-calculated intellectual exercise than it is an appeal
to warm-hearted human emotions. With aesthetic, moral,
or spiritual values it has little to do. Hence it has not that
permanency that makes for true literature. Based on incident
and accidental circumstance rather than character
it engages the reader temporarily by its cleverness, but it
does not acquaint him with living characters to whom he
loves to return for an enlargement of that acquaintanceship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Canadian species of short story is distinguished by
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>
a high artistic unity of structure and effect and in that
respect reflects the influence of Poe upon all modern short
story writing, but there is this difference, that it achieves
its unity of effect and its dramatic interest not by mechanically
constructed climaxes but by developments arising out
of the inherent traits and dispositions of the personages of
the story. Its basis is the solid rock of character. The
Canadian short story as a distinctive type does not present
the excessively climactic plot; nevertheless, it is more truly
a real story than either the plot story of the American and
French writers or the fine psychological situations of successful
English story writers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we see it, this peculiar quality of the Canadian short
story is rooted in some quality of Canadian nationality.
No Canadian writer can be said to have originated the
method. Each appears to evolve some modification of it
particularly adapted to his own field.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Old Man Savarin and Other Tales</span>, by Edward William
Thomson (1895) contains a number of stories of Canadian
life differing widely in emotional interest. There is the near
burlesque of <span class='it'>Old Man Savarin</span>, with the incident of the
fist fight which lasted for four hours, although the two
combatants never reached within striking distance of each
other all that time; <span class='it'>McGrath’s Bad Night</span> portrays a
pathetic picture of a family on the verge of starvation,
to which is added the greater pathos of the breakdown of
a man’s principles of honesty; <span class='it'>The Privilege of the Limits</span>,
wherein the author captures and presents effectively the
dry, pawky humor of the Scot; the sorrowful dillusionment
of youthful imagination in <span class='it'>The Shining Cross of
Rigaud</span>; superstitious terror overcome by plain common
sense in <span class='it'>Red Headed Windego</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stories with Eastern Ontario and Quebec for their
setting show a loving intimacy and understanding of the
plain people—the habitant, the river driver, the lumberman,
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
the farmer; and the author is at his best in his
delineation of the Glengarry Scot or the Quebec habitant.
Thomson is scarcely a stylist. There is a freedom, even
looseness, in his story structure, and he employs sometimes
the device of introducing a narrator for his tale. But in
his stories of the Canadian type and setting his warm
friendliness for his characters radiates a glow of enthusiasm
that captures and holds the reader. Not all Thomson’s
stories, however, are of this type—in <span class='it'>Petherick’s
Peril</span>, there is an approach to the horror tale of Poe; and
in <span class='it'>The Swartz Diamond</span> there is the trap-springing device
of the surprise ending, while <span class='it'>Boss of the World</span> is an example
of the ‘tall story’ which produces its humor by the
exaggeration of its ideas—these stories we surmise to be
the result of influences which surrounded E. W. Thomson
in his editorial offices in a Boston magazine publishing
firm.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>In the Village of Viger</span> (1896), by Duncan Campbell
Scott is a little volume of prose tales of French Canada,
published in Boston by Copeland and Day. These stories
affect the heart and imagination with a reality and sense of
actuality as if one had dwelt in Viger and had daily come
face to face with Mademoiselle Viau, the little milliner;
Madame Laroque, gossip and reformer; Monsieur Cuerrier,
kind-hearted postmaster; brandy-tippling Paul Arbique
and his wife; Hans Blumenthal, the expatriate German
watchmaker; Pierre, and the lovely but intriguing
Eloise of No. 68 rue Alfred de Musset; Jean Francois,
the mysterious blind peddler; Paul Farlotte who was always
saving up to revisit France, and gave up the project
on the day he dreamed that his mother had died—and all
the rest in this gallery of lovable characters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reality and veracity of Dr. Scott’s character delineation
produces exquisite and infallible character-vignettes,
or Rembrandtesque word-etchings, lovely in
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
‘values’ and in spiritual <span class='it'>chiaroscuro</span>—depths within depths
of a single character as in Charles Desjardins in the tragic
story of <span class='it'>The Desjardins</span>. Yet in his handling of the
tragic he awakens, not a pity that produces fear or horror
or disgust, but a gentle pity that engenders sympathy. We
appreciate the ‘little milliner’s’ loyalty—begotten of pure
love—to her rascal lover, a common thief. The skilful
sympathetic handling of the subject gives to love a new
dignity and to loyalty a new grandeur. The pathos moves
to a rise and fall, but never so overwhelms the emotions
as to cause tears; rather does it subdue the soul and
leave in the heart of the reader a gentle welling up of
sympathy, a benignant sense of fellowship with finite and
erring humanity, and a tender peace. When a reader
finishes one of Dr. Scott’s stories of the pathetic episode—The
<span class='it'>Little Milliner</span>, <span class='it'>The Desjardins</span>, <span class='it'>Sedan</span>, <span class='it'>Paul Farlotte</span>—he
experiences no violent wrench of the heart-strings—sheds
no tears—but is gently and sweetly touched; feels
with the unfortunate and afflicted; sees the veil that obscures
the hard workaday world lifted; and beholds life
and the world suffused with a ‘grey-eyed loveliness.’ This
is all superb artistry in emotional and spiritual love, by one
who has had intimate glimpses into the human heart and
into the stern face of sublimity in human character and in
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, too, his treatment of the comedy in human character
and existence. Human destiny and fate are too dear and
pathetic to him to allow him to engage his art in any
raucous laughter. The smiles he evokes are based on sympathetic
fellow-feeling, on tenderness. We are amused,
yet not unsympathetic, at the rage of Madame Laroque,
defeated in a long-cherished love, and hope of ultimate
marriage, by the elopement of her ward, Cesarine, with
the postmaster (<span class='it'>The Wooing of Monsieur Cuerrier</span>); the
futilities of old Paul Farlotte, who would see ‘la belle
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
France’ before he dies, envisage a comic character, but
subdue our laughter with the pathos of frustrated desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These themes, we see, are chosen from character and
life in a typical French-Canadian village, yet the sentiments,
the ideals of human love and character and conduct, and
the natural and spiritual color, are Canadian and even universal.
They depend not upon mere accidents of circumstance,
but upon lasting and universal human emotions and
human relationships—permanent literary values. In these
stories, Dr. Scott achieves structural unity and harmony of
emotional tone with an entire absence of any striving for
effect—with that finished art that conceals the artifice of
the craftsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always a careful workman rather than a prolific
writer, it was not until 1923 that Duncan Campbell Scott
published another volume of short stories, <span class='it'>The Witching of
Elspie</span>. Some of these are French-Canadian in their setting,
but those most exquisitely wrought deal with the lonely
and heart-searching life of the Hudson Bay posts. Although
Scott’s method was fully formed in his first volume,
there is here a very evident advance in artistry, a greater
economy in expression, but a deeper intensity of effect.
Here he shows a remarkable skill in the almost imperceptible
transition from explanation or description to the
inside of the mind of the varying personages of the story
and back again to description or explanation—one of the
most artistic touches of the work of a finished craftsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles G. D. Roberts developed, in the story of animal
psychology, a species of Canadian short story that depends
not so much upon emotional and artistic effects and a unity
of impressionistic tone as upon intellectual and stylistic
effects and novelty of theme. Scott worked with an artistry
so exquisite that his stories possess the simplicity and
directness which conceal art. Roberts wrought his animal
and romantic short stories with an artistry so much in the
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
manner of the prose-poet that they reveal the stylist consciously
aiming to impress the intellect with niceties of
structure, and the sensibility with word-painting, always
<span class='it'>couleur de rose</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Roberts is the psychologist he is also most the
true structural stylist. But for an example of more impressionistic
color, of sheer word-painting, of prose-poetry
<span class='it'>couleur de rose</span>, the following paragraphs from <span class='it'>The Watchers
in the Swamp</span> are convincing:—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Under the first pale lilac wash of evening, just where the slow
stream of the Lost-Water slipped placidly from the open meadows
into the osier-and-bulrush tangles of the swamp, a hermit
thrush, perched in the topmost spray of a young elm tree, was
fluting out his lonely and tranquil ecstasy to the last of the
sunset.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>It was high morning in the heart of the swamp. From a sky of
purest cobalt flecked sparsely with silver-white wisps of
cloud, the sun glowed down with tempered, fruitful warmth
upon the tender green of the half-grown rushes and already
rank water-grasses—the young leafage of the alder and willow
thickets—the wide pools and narrow, linking lanes of unruffled
water already mantling in spots with lily-pad and arrow-weed.
A few big red-and-black butterflies wavered aimlessly above
the reed-tops. Here and there, with a faint elfin clashing of
transparent wings, a dragon-fly, a gleam of emerald and amethyst
fire, flashed low over the water. From every thicket came
a soft chatter of the nesting red-shouldered blackbirds.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These stories are lyrical poems in prose; as an impressionistic
stylist in the medium of the animal short story
Roberts is inimitable. We find the same mellifluous prose
(as Mr. T. G. Marquis discriminatingly terms it) in his
romantic short stories, <span class='it'>By the Marshes of Minas</span>, in which
themes, settings, and color are authentically Canadian
(Acadian).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gilbert Parker’s short stories exhibit many of the qualities
of his longer fiction. They are not always as artistically
constructed as those of Duncan Campbell Scott, nor
are they as finely written as those of Roberts, but in the
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
main they are based on sufficient character motivation and
have a sustained dramatic power. Ernest Thompson Seton
and W. A. Fraser are engaging tellers of short tales abounding
in incident and humor, with a sound basis of characterization,
yet of the short story writers of the Systematic
School, Duncan Campbell Scott has produced the most
uniformly excellent work.</p>

<h3>William Henry Drummond</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>THE NEW CANADIAN GENRE OF IDYLLIC POETRY—WILLIAM
HENRY DRUMMOND, INTERPRETER OF THE HABITANT—POET
OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IN CANADA.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>he</span> Canadian <span class='it'>voyageur</span> and <span class='it'>habitant</span>, the lumberman,
and peasant of French Canada are ‘children of nature’—human,
simple, shy, warm-hearted, honest, and manly.
They were not always thus sympathetically conceived or
regarded by most of their English-speaking compatriots.
They, therefore, needed a sympathetic interpreter who
would reveal their inward spirit and true character, mental
and moral. Strangely, but according to the inscrutable
methods of Providence, the man who was to be the friend
and sympathetic interpreter of the French-Canadian peasant,
was born in Ireland in 1854. He was William Henry
Drummond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drummond emigrated to Canada when but a mere lad,
before Old Country education and culture had any chance
to mould his mind and imagination and moral attitudes.
While, then, Drummond himself was an <span class='it'>émigré</span>, his verse,
like that of Isabella Valancy Crawford and for the same
reasons of formative influences in Canada, is Canadian.
It is indeed regional, but it is also indigenous poetry—in
substance, in diction, in imagery, and in craftsmanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>William Henry Drummond, like the <span class='it'>dramatis personae</span>
of his poems, the <span class='it'>voyageur</span> and <span class='it'>habitant</span>, was a ‘child of
nature.’ No other kind of man, save this large-bodied,
warm-hearted, open-minded lover of human kin and of
the creatures that live in the wild, who saw and felt the
common things of life, as the <span class='it'>habitant</span> saw and felt them,
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
could have been a truthful interpreter of the <span class='it'>habitant</span>. The
merely scholarly poet, the poet of a hothouse refinement,
the poet who went to work at the craftsmanship of poetry
as if he were carving arabesques in verse, could not have
the imaginative insight into the mind and heart of the
French-Canadian peasant and the sympathy with him that
would make it possible for such a poet, with kindly, playful
humor, to express the elemental feelings and thoughts—the
real humanity—of the <span class='it'>habitant</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drummond was above all things a human poet.
His sympathies were inclusive. By intuition he could
feel just as the <span class='it'>habitant</span> felt about good and evil
in the universe. Drummond’s heart was warm and
large and religious, which meant that he could
call nothing that was made in the image of God common
or outcast. Though he was well read in the modern
poets and was a student of literature, he was not a bookish
man. He distinguished between the literature which possessed
only aesthetic and artistic beauties and that which
was the embodiment of the finer goods of the spirit, the
inalienable satisfactions of existence. He loved only the
literature that was human and beautiful—simple, pure,
and true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As, then, a ‘child of nature,’ with a large, sympathetic
heart and a Keltic vision of the ‘divinity’ which is in all
men and also in the wild creatures that are near to Nature,
and with a gift of ready expression in rhythmical verse,
Drummond was uniquely fitted to be the interpreter of his
simple, kindly, reticent, but genuinely human and sincere,
fellow-being, the Canadian <span class='it'>habitant</span>. Thus singularly fitted
to be, as he has been called, ‘the Poet of the Habitant,’
Drummond, in his verse, actually performed a social and
a literary service for his country. On the social side, to
the English-speaking Canadian, who up to the last decade
of the 19th century considered the <span class='it'>habitant</span> as little better
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
than a chattel, Drummond revealed the human, lovable, and
admirable virtues of the humble French-speaking compatriot,
and also engendered in the English-speaking
Canadian a sincere respect and affection for his French-speaking
fellow countryman. On the literary side, Drummond
created a gallery of <span class='it'>genre</span> pictures and spiritual portraits
which constitute a unique contribution, not only to
Canadian poetic Literature, but also to English Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under what inspiration or vision, hitherto not vouchsafed
to any other Canadian poet, did Drummond write,
and what really novel and important contributions did he
make to Canadian poetry and to world literature?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He discovered and presented to the world, for the first
time, the New Romance in Canada, as Kirby and Sir
Gilbert Parker had discovered and presented the Old Romance.
He created a new form of the Canadian Idyll.
He placed on the stage of the world a group of new Characters
and, through them, originated a new species or type
of World Humor. Pre-eminently Drummond is the Poet
and Humorist of the New Social Democracy in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until the publication of Drummond’s first creative work,
<span class='it'>The Habitant and Other French-Canadian Poems</span> (1897),
the French-Canadian, in general, was appreciated only according
to the types seen in the towns and cities. In particular,
the French-Canadian <span class='it'>voyageur</span> and <span class='it'>habitant</span> were
appreciated only as the merry hearts who had sung the
old <span class='it'>chansons</span> on the rivers of Quebec Province—and, as
their English-speaking compatriots fancied, in the academic
and eviscerated English translations in which they heard
these <span class='it'>chansons</span>. No one, up to the time of Drummond’s
first volume, had revealed the mind and heart of the real,
the living <span class='it'>habitant</span>, <span class='it'>voyageur</span>, lumberman, and peasant in
Old Quebec. No one before Drummond had sung their
heart songs in the patois that is theirs when attempting
to express their thoughts and emotions to their supercilious
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
and not too respectful English-speaking compatriots. But
Drummond produced truthful, naturalistic pictures of the
real, the <span class='it'>living</span> French-Canadian <span class='it'>habitant</span>, lumberman, and
peasant as they expressed their thoughts and emotions about
life and their fellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not do this by a sort of reporting. He did it
by letting them talk for themselves in their own patois.
Thus he gave to his pictures of the French-Canadian <span class='it'>habitant</span>,
lumberman, and peasant, a racy and dramatic realism
which distinguishes them as ‘characters’ apart in Canadian,
in English, and in world literature. This is the first reason
why William Henry Drummond must be regarded as an
absolute creator of literary species. He created a new
form of romantic genre poetry, gave it reality, veracity,
and ideality. This is what Louis Fréchette meant when
in his Introduction to Drummond’s first volume, he hailed
Drummond as ‘the pathfinder of a new land of song.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>In what way did Drummond give true <span class='it'>ideality</span> to the
life and character which he presented also with a convincing
realism and veracity? There is a species of romance which
is the sheer invention of the fancy or imagination. It presents
a life and character that have never existed and could
not be possible anywhere on earth. That kind of romance
is so ‘fantastic’ as to be absolutely unreal. There is another
kind of romance which is based on real imagination of
supposed real life and real personages. This sort of romance
is typified by fairy tales, not the fairy tales of all
lands, but of Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland. The
people actually believe in the real existence of fairies, and
imagine these invisible creatures in the forms of human
beings. Romances about them and their doings are, therefore,
not fantastic, but are based on a kind of reality.
Again: there is a species of romance based upon the imagining
of real personages in impossible situations and doing
impossible things. It exists in Canadian Literature in those
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>
romances in which the Indian conducts himself in ways that
could only be possible with men of civilized natures and
civilized ideas. This kind of romance is not unreal; it is
<span class='it'>too ideal</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In poetically conceiving and presenting the French-Canadian
<span class='it'>habitant</span>, lumberman, or peasant, Drummond
might have drawn them as fantastic, or fanciful, or absolutely
ideal characters. Or, he might have drawn them,
as Service, for instance, has limned his characters of the
trails and mining camps, with an accentuated or rude
realism. Drummond employed none of these methods. He
presented the French-Canadian <span class='it'>habitant</span>, lumberman, and
peasant as they really <span class='it'>appear</span> on the outside, and as they
ideally <span class='it'>are</span> on the inside, to the vision which sympathetically
divines their feelings, emotions, aspirations, sorrows, joys,
and consolations. Drummond’s poetic eye perceived the
ideal spirit of the French-Canadian <span class='it'>habitant</span> as it shines
through the outer, rude, homely, simple, hesitant creature
whom the English-speaking compatriot only too often, till
Drummond’s time, took to be of a lower and less spiritual
order than himself. By this combined realistic and idealistic
treatment of the character and life of the French-Canadian
<span class='it'>habitant</span>, lumberman, and peasant, Drummond
created a new species of Canadian <span class='it'>genre</span> poetry, a new form
of the Canadian Idyll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a creator, Drummond is entitled to another distinction.
He originated a new and distinct type of Humor.
There were humorists before and since Drummond. There
was the prose humor of Haliburton’s <span class='it'>Sam Slick</span>. There
was the verse humor of Howe and of Lanigan. There was
the prose humor of De Mille and of Mrs. Cotes. There
have been the prose humor of Leacock and the verse humor
of Service. But the only humor of all these that is likely
to perdure as world literature is that of Haliburton.
Drummond has created a humor which also is likely to
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
live in permanent literature. It is distinguished from all
the other humor written in Canada by the fact that it is
never satiric or malicious or ungenial, or mere humor for
the sake of raising a laugh or to ridicule another. It is
humor with <span class='it'>pathos</span>. Just as Haliburton is unique as a
satiric humorist, so Drummond is unique as a sympathetic
and interpretative humorist. He is a Master of Humor
and of Pathos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His work is so well known throughout the world that
it is hardly necessary to quote examples of his humor. Mere
excerpts will not suffice. We may, however, recall, as
outstanding examples, <span class='it'>The Wreck of the Julie Plante</span>, <span class='it'>How
Bateese Came Home</span>, <span class='it'>The Curé of Calumette</span>, <span class='it'>Dominique</span>,
<span class='it'>The Corduroy Road</span>, <span class='it'>Little Bateese</span>, <span class='it'>Johnnie Courteau</span>, and
<span class='it'>When Albani Sang</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few words on Drummond’s use of a patois or dialect
and on his verse technique will be sufficient. It is by his
patois that he gives not only naturalness but also veracity
to the speech of his characters. His dialect is pure and
clean and is felt by the reader as natural and genuine. As
to technique, Drummond is a master of simple but flowing
rhythm and obtains his rhymes with an ease and naturalness
that disclose him as an original inventor of rhyme. He
elected to be ‘The Poet of the Habitant,’ and as such he is
unique. Yet his poetry in this form, as well as in other
forms, clearly shows that if he had essayed the writing
of verse on traditional themes and in a traditional manner,
he could have been a poet of considerable distinction. It
is best, however, to leave him with his natural distinction
and glory about him—the Poet of the Habitant. As the
discoverer of the New Romance in Canada, as the Creator
of the New Canadian Idyll, and as the Master of a unique
species of Canadian Humor and Pathos, William Henry
Drummond made a signally original contribution to the
quantity and quality of the creative literature of Canada.</p>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>THE DECADENT INTERIM IN CANADIAN LITERATURE—THE
VAUDEVILLE SCHOOL OF POETS—ROBERT W. SERVICE, ROBERT
J. C. STEAD, AND OTHERS.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span><span class='sc'>ot</span> ineptly, though somewhat jocosely, we may group
Canadian Poets in the Post-Confederation period,
from 1887 to 1907, into three Schools, and label them with
characteristic sobriquets. Already Archibald Lampman,
Wilfred Campbell, Duncan Campbell Scott, with Pauline
Johnson and Frederick George Scott, have been called ‘The
Great Lakes School.’ This is a dignified sobriquet, and
derives its descriptive aptness from the native environment,
or from the themes, of these poets, or from both. Again:
Charles G. D. Roberts and Bliss Carman have been named
‘The Birchbark School.’ This is a jocose, playful sobriquet,
and was applied to these poets because ‘they use the
mottled scrolls of the Red Man’s papyrus to build a canoe,
or as a vehicle for verse, with equal dexterity.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>By similar tokens, the throng of verse-makers whose
vogue formed a decadent interim in Canadian poetry, beginning
with the publication of Robert Service’s <span class='it'>Songs of
a Sourdough</span> (1907) and ending with the publication of his
<span class='it'>Rhymes of a Rolling Stone</span> (1913), may be signalized as
‘The Vaudeville School.’ On account of the themes of
their verse, its special and distinguishing technique,
and its particular appeal to popular or vulgar taste, this
sobriquet, as applied to Robert Service, Robert Stead, Paul
Agar, George B. Field, Milton W. Yorke (<span class='it'>pseud.</span> Derby
Bill), Robert T. Anderson, John Mortimer, James P.
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
Haverson, Charles W. MacCrossan, Hamilton Wigle, and
others, is just, apt, and veracious. It must be understood,
however, to convey nothing of scorn or contempt or derision,
but to be only a pedagogical formula for summarizing the
qualities of the verse, the ideals, the methods, and the
craftsmanship of the great majority of the poets here
named ‘The Vaudeville School.’ They might have been
dubbed ‘The Sourdough School,’ were it not that of them
all only Service deals with those picturesque and picaresque
humans known in the slang of the Canadian gold-mining
camps as ‘Sourdoughs,’ and were it not that this name,
used as sobriquet, would be derisive rather than sincerely
descriptive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As used here, the term Vaudeville harks back to its
original French connotation. As applied to the verse of
Service, Stead, Haverson, Field, Yorke, and the others,
it means, first, entertainment which appeals to popular or
vulgar or low taste in verse. It means, secondly, arresting
or violent methods in the technique of vividness. In fact,
it is on the side of the technique of vividness in verse-color
and verse-rhythms rather than on the side of the picturesque
and often picaresque matter—characters and situations—of
the verse of this School that the term Vaudeville is most
apt and veracious, and that it is applied here as a descriptive
epithet in the ‘working’ vocabulary of literary criticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The sublimation of the technique of emotional vividness,
to the exclusion of all regard for the intrinsic and the aesthetic
beauty and moral dignity of poetry</span>—this is the
essential formula of the verse of the Vaudeville School
of Canadian poets. Their aims or motives were sincere
and human. One motive was genuinely aesthetic: they
wished to write verse that would escape the emotional
<span class='it'>deadness</span> of the traditional themes and manner of Canadian
poetry. The other motive was pragmatic: they wished
to write rhythmic and rimed social documents in verse
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
which would have such novelty of theme and such dramatic
or theatrical or ‘sensational’ content as immediately to create
a demand for the ‘new poetry’ and make it readily marketable.
Thus should ‘the art of poetry’ become at once both
pleasurable and profitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How were these ends to be achieved? ‘I am one who
left off singing Alleluias,’ said Dante, poet of the immortal
‘Vision’ of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. Thus Dante,
desiring to get away from the conventional deadness of
saying that he, as a poet, was a messenger from Heaven
to reveal spiritual beauty to his fellows, makes use of one
of the principles of the technique of vividness. He employs
the unusual phrase, the lively, arresting phrase that
would be sure to strike and vividly impress the average
mind or imagination. In short, Dante invents and uses
picturesque slang: for ‘singing Alleluias’ is slang, but how
poetically suggestive it is, how vivid!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Canadian Vaudeville verse-makers realized the
poetic suggestiveness and the vividness of the picaresque
speech of the Far West and the High North. They also
knew how these sections of the country were rich in picturesque
and picaresque characters and in the ‘wild and
woolly’ life which produces strange and violent drama and
melodrama, which is all the more appealing to the imagination
of men and women because it is real and ‘stranger
than fiction.’ It was a life full of moral (or immoral) color
of speech, and action—of compelling interest. Thus ready
to hand in Canada lay for immediate use the materials and
the basal technical principle—the recipe—for the ‘making,’
not the ‘creation,’ of Vaudeville poetry. What was that
recipe? Simply this. <span class='it'>Lilt in plangent anapaestic metres
or rhythms the picaresque melodrama of the mining camps
in the High North and the melodrama of the ‘chevalerie’ of
the Far West.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A single stanza from <span class='it'>The Shooting of Dan McGrew</span>
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
by Robert Service (<span class='it'>Songs of a Sourdough</span>, 1907) affords
ample proof and illustration of the vaudeville qualities of
this decadent verse:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar way;</p>
<p class='line0'>In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him sway;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then his lips went in a kind of grin, and he spoke, and his voice was calm;</p>
<p class='line0'>And, ‘Boys,’ says he, ‘you don’t know me, and none of you care a damn;</p>
<p class='line0'>But I want to state, and my words are straight, and I’ll bet my poke they’re true,</p>
<p class='line0'>That one of you is a hound of hell .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that one is Dan McGrew.’</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>That is an impressive characteristic example of the
technique of vividness, by the Canadian master of them all.
But let no one call it poetry. Service’s astounding vogue
for six years—it is now vanished—was not due to the
<span class='it'>poetry</span> in his verse, but to the arresting or violent <span class='it'>drama</span>
and <span class='it'>melodrama</span> in it, made more arresting or compelling
by the infectious swing or lilt of the anapaestic rhythm.
This rhythm is his only <span class='it'>forte</span> in verbal music, though he
also employs alliteration successfully. This <span class='it'>forte</span> is seen
to be a limitation and a weakness, as it also was and is in
his alleged artistic foster-father, Rudyard Kipling. For
as soon as Service attempts to employ another rhythm better
suited to higher thought than the picaresque matter of
strictly ‘Sourdough’ Songs, the results are disastrous. He
fails to hold the attention; and, inasmuch as there are no
compensating rhythmic values, all that is left is the strained
and bizarre effect of cheap melodrama. A singular example
of this kind of weakness and failure in Service is
his <span class='it'>My Madonna</span>, in which he aims consciously and seriously
to achieve a <span class='it'>tour de force</span> in religious sentiment, but falls
into flat <span class='it'>bathos</span> of melodrama (<span class='it'>Songs of a Sourdough</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>If proof is wanted that the recipe for writing Vaudeville
verse is simply to lilt in anapaestic metre and rhythm the
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
melodrama of the Far West <span class='it'>chevalerie</span>, proof and illustration
are furnished by a stanza from <span class='it'>Sergeant Blue</span> by
Robert Stead (<span class='it'>Kitchener and Other Poems</span>, 1917):—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Sergeant Blue of the Mounted Police was a so-so kind of a guy;</p>
<p class='line0'>He swore a bit, and he lied a bit, and he boozed a bit on the sly;</p>
<p class='line0'>But he held the post at Snake Creek Bend for country and home and God,</p>
<p class='line0'>And he cured the first and forgot the rest—which wasn’t the least bit odd.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The amazing and pathetic fact about Robert Service
is that he really possessed authentic poetic genius, and
sometimes did write pure poetry. At his best Stead has
written some satisfying <span class='it'>genre</span> poetry and story-telling
ballads. But Stead could not rise beyond the homely-pathetic
and the melodramatic in Western <span class='it'>chevalerie</span> into
the realm of pure poetry. He kept always to the level of
his lowly subject. Service, however, fell or rose to the
level of his subject. In short, while most of Service’s verse
is popular Vaudeville, considerable of it violent melodrama,
and much of it drama simply, some of his verse is genuinely
poetical, charged with pure beauty and poetic significance.
How nobly Service has conceived, how passionately
expressed in lovely color-images and pervasive vowel
and alliterative music, and how philosophically interpreted
Nature in his poem <span class='it'>The Mountain and the Lake</span>:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I know a mountain thrilling to the stars,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Peerless and pure, and pinnacled with snow;</p>
<p class='line0'>Glimpsing the golden dawn o’er coral bars,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Flaunting the vanished sunset’s garnet glow;</p>
<p class='line0'>Proudly patrician, passionless, serene;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Soaring in silvered steeps where cloud-surfs break;</p>
<p class='line0'>Virgin and vestal—oh, a very Queen!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And at her feet there dreams a quiet lake.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>In that poem Service has given us an arresting and
memorable picture of pure beauty in Nature. It is beautiful
and unforgettable because it has poetic <span class='it'>Style</span>. Stead
and the other members of the Vaudeville School, with the
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
exception at times of Service when at his best, lacked
genius for style in verse, without which verse, whether
its subject or theme be low or high, realistic or idealistic,
cannot rise to the dignity of poetry. Service, Stead, and
the rest are never authentic Realists. They could not avoid
the melodramatic in the matter of their verse and the
plangent and vivid in its technique. Always they deliberately
set out to assault the senses and the sensibilities.
Kipling could be realistic and by virtue of his style rise
to the dignity of poetry. But for the lack of style, the
hectic realism of Service and Stead never rises above the
crudely melodramatic or Vaudevillian. As picaresque
realists they are, to quote Mr. E. B. Osborn, ‘far behind
the Australian and compare very unfavorably with the
minor masters of Quebec.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many of the most effective pieces in Service’s first
volume (<span class='it'>Songs of a Sourdough</span>) were deliberate imitations
of Kipling. But later he gave some promise of developing
an independent manner of his own, the manner which is
disclosed in <span class='it'>The Mountain and the Lake</span>, and which indubitably
revealed in him innate original powers for painting
the beauty and sublimity of Nature in the Arctic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Service did not hold to his own manner; and Stead and
the other Vaudevillians were innately incapable of any
manner of their own. At length the vogue of the Vaudeville
poets passed, having in no way affected the stream of
aesthetic and artistic poetry which began with the Systematic
School and which flowed on, pure and undefiled, if
placid and noiseless, through the poetry of the later generation
and into the Restoration Period or Second Renaissance
in Canadian Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fundamental to the point of view of the criticism which
follows is this proposition:—The poetry of the Vaudeville
School for the most part must be regarded, not strictly as
an aesthetic phenomenon, but rather as an envisagement of
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>
certain phases of the civilization of Canada in that period—that
is, as a series of <span class='it'>social documents</span>. There is nothing
wrong in treating contemporary phases of civilization in
poetry with such vividness and veracity that they really
become social documents of the period which they envisage;
but they are of no aesthetic worth if they are not consecrated
to and by art. How a social document, when sublimated
by fine art, can become authentic poetry may be discovered
by turning to Pauline Johnson’s musical and swift-moving
lyric <span class='it'>Prairie Greyhounds</span>, descriptive of the transcontinental
trains and their service to Canadian civilization,
or to Mr. C. G. D. Roberts’ noble sonnet <span class='it'>The Train Among
the Hills</span>, or to his equally fine sonnet of the soil <span class='it'>The
Sower</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be realized that the sources of poetic inspiration
in Canada have considerably shifted from the Atlantic,
the Land of Evangeline, the Great Lakes, and the Laurentians
to the Prairies, the Rockies, and the ice-clad wildernesses
of the High North. Now, it was inevitable that under
the inchoate and unsettled conditions of civilization in these
Far West and High North sections of the Dominion, the
mere inspiration to write verse should have been uppermost
and that considerations of form should have appeared
secondary or insignificant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The themes treated in the Vaudeville verse were necessarily
new; and when the Western or Yukon poets published
their verses the newness of their themes and their
naïve disregard of technical niceties were mistaken in the
East for originality, vigor, freshness, and breeziness in art,
and were welcomed and read by all classes of Canadians
with avidity as ‘real,’ not ‘hothouse,’ poetry. There we
have the explanation of the astonishing vogue of the verses
of Service and Stead, and of their imitators. But their
verses, far from being examples of genuine originality in
invention of poetic themes and of really new art, exemplify
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>
the total absence of art; and far from being ‘real’ poetry,
are totally devoid of the chaste speech, lovely imagery,
dulcet music, and exquisite emotion which constitute true
poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a distinct moral fault on the part of Service that
he should have chosen to give us in verse what he had better
written in prose. The right form for social documents of
picaresque communities is prose. Further: it is a law of
aesthetics, a law exemplified most finely in Homer, that,
whenever possible, all the elements in a work of art should
each be intrinsically beautiful. Service deliberately chose
themes which disregarded that law. We could forgive
him for that if he had redeemed the vulgarity of the themes
by beautiful craftsmanship in versification. His poetry is
bad not because it is wicked or picaresque or risqué, but
because it is aesthetically bad through and through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the Vaudeville Period Roberts, Campbell, Carman,
Duncan Campbell Scott, Canon Scott, Pauline
Johnson, Arthur Stringer, Albert E. S. Smythe, Ethelwyn
Wetherald, Jean Blewett, Helena Coleman, Virna Sheard,
the late Marjorie Pickthall, Katherine Hale, Jean Graham,
Peter McArthur, Richard Scrace, Lucy M. Montgomery
and a host of others published aesthetically satisfying
poetry. For their spirit was of the spirit which inaugurated
the First Renaissance in Canadian poetry. But the spirit
of Service and the lesser poets of the Vaudeville School was
identical with that which animated the early Canadian
verse-makers before the times of Breakenridge, Sangster,
Mair, and John Reade. In spirit and in craftsmanship
the poetry of the Vaudeville School was essentially a recrudescence
of the poetry that made glad the hearts of the
‘Bush’ and ‘Clearing’ settlers of Canada in the first and
second quarters of the last century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That a New Poetry will arise in Canada and that it will
originate and flourish in the Canadian Far West, is highly
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
probable, because the prairie-lands of the West, their endless
fields of grain sheening in the sun and billowing in rhythmic
swaying to the winds and the mighty vastnesses of land
and sky awaken moods and appreciations of Nature similar
to those stirred in men by the sea. It was, in Bliss Carman’s
fine phrase, ‘the glad indomitable sea’ and the inland
seas that inspired the Maritime and Lake poets who began
the First Renaissance of Canadian Poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if any of the future Canadian poet, Western or
Eastern, should prefer or incline to turn back to the ways
of Service and Stead, let him reflect that since beauty is
our clearest manifestation of the union of the real and the
ideal, that is, of perfection, not to love and promote beauty
in poetry is so far forth to refuse to love and promote the
Godlike in the hearts of mankind, for perfection is the essence
of the Godhead. To become a poet may not be a
moral duty. But if one elects the office of poet, then to
perfect oneself, as far as possible, in poetic artistry for the
sake of beautifully or compellingly embodying in verse
whatsoever is lovely in Nature or noble in ideas, is to attain
to high moral dignity in one’s own soul as a poet and to
impress on the world the high spiritual function of poetry.</p>

Marjorie Pickthall’s first volume of verse, <span class='it'>Drift of
Pinions</span> (1913), and on to the present, the Restoration or
Second Renaissance Period in Canadian Literature. It is
a ‘restoration’ period because it marks a return, after the
Decadent Interim of the Vaudeville School (1907-1912),
to the aesthetic and artistic ideals of the first systematic
group of native-born Canadian writers. It is a ‘renaissance’
because the writers of the period undertook the systematic
production of original authentic literature, and because they
wrote under the inspiration of new themes, ideals, and
forms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By 1913 when the Canadian public had tired of the
picaresque themes and the plashing anapaests of Robert
Service, and the vogue of the Vaudeville School had passed,
there was a demand for clean and sweet sustenance of the
soul and refreshing new verbal music for the spirit. It
was a demand for pure Beauty—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marjorie Pickthall was the first to give the Canadian
public sweet draughts of a new poetic wine of life. She
engaged the attention of the Canadian public with the same
immediacy and delight as the early lyrics of Tennyson and
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
Swinburne captivated the English lovers of poetry. Set for
the most part to a new or, so far as Canada was concerned,
a strange music of trochaic, anapaestic, and syncopated
metres and rhythms, rich in vowel-harmonies and the tone-color
of consonance, assonance, and exquisite alliteration,
her songs changed the world about her into an earthly
paradise. At first Marjorie Pickthall arrested attention as
a young unknown poet singing shyly from a corner in a
daily newspaper or magazine, but singing with a rare beauty
of imagery and of color from Nature, and with a fresh
and dulcet verbal melody, heard as overtones above the
more plashing, plangent rhythms of Service and his colleagues.
It seemed as if Pan had come again to earth, so
idyllic was the Nature-beauty and so simple and dulcet was
the melody of her poetry, as in, for instance, <span class='it'>The Little

It was inevitable, then, that the Canadian public—and

tenderness, wistfulness, and the engaging music of such a
poem as Marjorie Pickthall’s <span class='it'>Mary Shepherdess</span>, the following
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>

<p class='pindent'>Francis Thompson or Alice Meynell could have written
the whole poem possibly with a more immaculate artistry,
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>
but not with any finer appeal to the religious or mystical
imagination, and not with a melody a whit more winning
as an end in itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having thus tasted the chief engagements of Marjorie
Pickthall’s poetry, we must in a more detailed way disclose
her genius and art as they appear in her lyrical poems in
<span class='it'>The Drift of Pinions</span> (1913), <span class='it'>The Lamp of Poor Souls</span>
(1916), and the posthumous volume <span class='it'>The Wood Carver’s
Wife</span> (1922)—the last of which contains a lyric drama
(the title-poem of the volume) and several lyrics. It is
as an adroit and exquisite craftswoman (or ‘artist’), rather
than for originality of imaginative conception, that, from
her first printed essays in verse to the last, Marjorie Pickthall
appeals as a specially gifted poet in Canada, and must
be accorded an honorable, possibly high, place in Canadian
poetic literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Technically, her poetry is distinguished by an extraordinarily
successful use of color epithets and verbal melody,
especially alliteration. The defects of her poetry are
not, on the whole, technical, but are defects, or rather limitations,
of genius. Broadly viewed, her poetry lacks breadth
of range and eloquence of style. By ‘style’ is not meant
Matthew Arnold’s conception or formula of what he called
‘the grand style.’ Marjorie Pickthall’s verse is free, flowing,
airy, graceful, tripping, musical; in a word, feminine.
But by thus much does it lack originality and seriousness
in the substance of its style, the qualities which give us the
sense of having met with beauty which is not a mere finely
distilled essence of loveliness, but which has strength, and
dignity, and power over the heart and the imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The key to the defects or limitations in Marjorie Pickthall’s
poetry was not her imagination but her ‘heart.’ She
loved and had sympathy only or specially with all little
creatures and things, with tender, frail, and helpless creatures
and things; and she felt profoundly a sort of injustice
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
in their fate, which begot in her a wistful wondering about
the justice of the ways of God. She therefore inevitably
impressed on her poetry her own feminine feeling for the
little and helpless creatures of earth, her own sympathy with
the evanescence of all the animate ‘little things’—children,
flowers, moths, birds, and ‘the little stars of Duna’—that
<span class='it'>for her</span> made existence tolerable or happy. Everywhere in
her verse appears her preoccupancy with the very word or
with suggestions of the word ‘little.’ It is this ‘heart’
limitation that causes her to show what would seem at
first sight to be a mannerism, namely, her predilection for
certain substantives and epithets, as, for instance, ‘moth,’
‘dove,’ ‘stars,’ ‘silver,’ ‘golden.’ It is not really a mannerism;
but a necessity of her heart and mind. For the creatures
and things her heart most loved, inevitably filled
her consciousness and excluded other creatures and things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while Marjorie Pickthall, by limitation of genius,
failed to attain to the sheer reaches in style and poetic
substance which mark the work of Lampman, Carman, and
D. C. Scott, and while she did not possess the ecstatic lilt
of Carman, still she must be ranked as a supreme lyrist
of the lovely, evanescent little things in the world. She
must be ranked high also as a technical artist. If her poetry
does not disclose her as able to achieve the finer strength
and beauties of technique in poetic style, that distinguish
the poetry of Lampman, Carman, and D. C. Scott, she is
less often at fault technically than the older poets. Her
technical artistry was not an acquired accomplishment; it
was a gift of Nature. For while the older poets won their
way, by hard striving, to their perfection in technique,
Marjorie Pickthall, as early as her sixteenth year of age,
displayed a precocious virtuosity, which was almost an
instinct, in adroit and ingenious verbal coloring and melody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the invention of winsome and vivid color epithets
and images and in her power for alliterative music in verse,
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
Marjorie Pickthall was, perhaps, surpassed by Pauline
Johnson. But Miss Pickthall was the more ingenious of
the two poets. The following examples are impressive:—‘Dark
with the green silence under the gold weather,’ ‘And
close the cowslips’ cups of honeyed gold,’ ‘Yellow for the
ripened rye, white for ladies’ wearing,’ ‘Where cling the
moths that are the longings of men,’ ‘Thy lips are bright
as the edge of the sword,’ ‘On the great green lawns o’
heaven,’ ‘He saw the moonlit rafters of the world,’ ‘Clear-footed
from the frontiers of the world,’ ‘And hear new
stars come singing from God’s hand,’ ‘To the wind that
cried last night like a soul in sin.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nature was Marjorie Pickthall’s chief mistress. In the
pictorial treatment of Nature the poet displayed special
gifts. It is not true to say that she had the Greek ‘feeling’
for Nature, or that the Nature in her verse was that of the
ancient Greeks. It was impossible for Marjorie Pickthall,
an Anglo-Canadian, to have a Greek imagination; and they
who claim that she had the ancient Greek feeling for
Nature, might as rightfully claim that she had the ancient
Gaelic or Keltic feeling for Nature, or the ancient Semitic
feeling for the presence of God, or the medieval Breton
feeling for Nature and the mystery of religious faith, which
some have remarked as ‘mysticism’ in Marjorie Pickthall’s
poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth is that, first, Marjorie Pickthall had a mind
and imagination which were naturally pagan, and that,
secondly, Nature was to her but the material for her fanciful
and pretty treatment in verse. But to the Greeks,
Nature, as perceived and embodied in their mythology and
poetry, was their vision of the real face and heart of Nature.
They actually <span class='it'>believed</span> in gods, goddesses, heroes,
muses, naiads, mermaids, satyrs, fauns, as being Nature
herself. This is what we mean by saying that the Greeks
were pagans. But Marjorie Pickthall had, by native gift,
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>
only the sensibility and imagination that were naturally
pagan in a love of and preference for thus <span class='it'>visualizing</span>
Nature. She had saturated her mind, by reading, with the
mythology of the Greeks; and her naturally pagan sensibility
and imagination re-colored and re-expressed this
material in a delightful pagan—not Greek—way in verse.
Marjorie Pickthall had no such lively sense of the <span class='it'>reality</span>
of divinity in Nature as had the Greeks. But she did have
a lively pagan, if Anglo-Canadian, imagination. And so,
with imaginative ‘<span class='it'>make-believe</span>’ she peopled Nature with
spirits, mermaids, pixies, fauns, elfs, playing with the Old
Nurse Nature, or with themselves, and rejoicing in the
sights, sounds, and the shy forest creatures, which they see
and hear amongst the woodlands, streams, hills. She thus
paganly <span class='it'>poetizes</span> Nature, beautifully, winningly; but it is
all a <span class='it'>tour de force</span> of the senses and imagination, achieved
in her ‘closet,’ where she was temporarily shut off from the
roar and turmoil of great cities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had she steeped herself as thoroughly in ancient Gaelic
lore, myths and legends, she would have written as engagingly
of the Nature of the Kelts. In her single poetic
essay in Gaelic ‘feeling’ for Nature—the Gael’s innate love
of Nature and the Homeland, his nostalgia—she failed in
a double way; first, by infelicitously giving her poem a
German title, <span class='it'>Wanderlied</span>, and, secondly, by a dull and commonplace
imitation, if not a parody, of Ethna Carbery,
Nora Hopper, Moira O’Neil, Katharine Tynan. When she
was sincerely and naturally pagan, as in most of her verse,
she succeeded admirably. But when she attempted to write
a ‘literary’ poem in the pagan spirit, as in <span class='it'>Wanderlied</span>, she
failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More of her imagery is derived from <span class='it'>actual Nature in
Canada</span> than from mythological Nature in ancient Greece.
The coloring from Canadian woods in Spring, Autumn,
and Winter is in her verse, also visualizations of Canadian
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>
fields and flowers, and the subtle handwork of ‘the Frost
King,’ and even Canadian domestic felicities made possible
by Nature, such as the winter arabesque on the windowpanes
in contrast with the inviting glow of burning logs
on the hearth:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>In short, if we were making a formula for Marjorie
Pickthall’s Nature poetry, we would employ this sub-title—‘Lyrics
in the Greek and the Canadian Modes of Pictorializing
Nature.’ Thus we should, by a single phrase, escape
absurdly alleging that an Anglo-Canadian mind possessed
Greek imagination and feeling for a mythological Nature;
and thus also make clear the fact that Marjorie Pickthall,
an Anglo-Canadian poet, was gifted not only with a lively
pagan sense of the beauty of a vanished world, but also with
a responsive sensibility to the beauty of a real and present
world of Nature in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In two respects, then, Marjorie Pickthall may be regarded
as having made original contributions to Canadian
literature. First, she winsomely <span class='it'>pictorialized</span>, not, as with
Lampman, spiritually interpreted, the face and pageantry
of Nature. Secondly, she subtilized verse technique in
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>
verbal coloring and melody. She had a light and tender
fancy, and, certainly for Canada, a rare artistry. She
brought Titania and Ariel to earth again; and suffused existence
with magical illusion, rhymed of light. The monument
she herself raised to her genius and memory is not
large and imposing; but it is, like her own spirit, chaste,
exquisite, beautiful—and enduring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another significant creative poet of the Second Renaissance
Period is Robert Norwood. Miss Pickthall was an
objective poet. Whenever her imagination concerned itself
with the spiritual realm it was to interpret only her own
<span class='it'>private</span> experience, strictly from a personal point of view.
Norwood is an interpreter of the Spirit to the Spirit—universalizing
his imaginative experiences. He is, to be
sure, a colorist and a musician in verse; but he is these
secondarily in aim, whereas primarily he is the singer and
interpreter of the meaning of Spiritual Love. In this field
he has made a really original contribution to native Canadian
poetry. In another field, however, he has made a still
greater contribution to Canadian poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The faculty of love, which is the deepest function of
man’s spiritual nature, is the imagination, the idealizing
faculty. The greatest and most spiritualizing power in
the world is love because its ultimate object is the heart of
the universe; that is, Immortal Love, which is God, for God
is Love. The greatest and most spiritualizing earthly object
of love is Woman, because it is the idealization, the
love, of Woman that most inspires men to achievement
in this life and to the deserving of union and companionship
on earth and in the life to come. That is to say, the
spiritual love of Woman is the chief inspiration of human
creative ideals and activities—of material achievement, of
creation in the fine arts, and of religion. Thus did Goethe
apostrophize this divine function of woman:—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>—the eternal woman-soul draws us forever upwards and
on; and thus has Robert Norwood also declared Woman’s
spiritualizing function:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>Life’s blossoms; all that has been, and is now,</p>
<p class='line0'>And ever shall be: Science, music and art,</p>
<p class='line0'>Religion, these, as from a fountain start</p>
<p class='line0'>The river, have been hers—man to endow.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It is Norwood’s mastery of verbal color and music and
his power of spiritual vision and exaltation—his interpretation
and treatment of Ideal Love—that constitute his
novel quality of fresh excellence in the poetry of the Second
Renaissance. Certainly in his sonnet-sequence <span class='it'>His Lady
of the Sonnets</span> (1915), he has enhanced the quality of Canadian
poetry. Uppermost in his heart and imagination is
the refining redemptive, transmuting power of Love, an absolute
joy in the thought of the spiritual union and companionship
of the Lover and the Beloved. To him Love
is a holy ideal; and Loving is the fusion of soul and soul,
of spirit and spirit, until the Lover and the Beloved become
one soul, one spirit, enamored of holiness in thought,
speech, and deed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As an example of Norwood’s sensuously colorful and
musical envisagement of the Ideal Love we quote the following
sonnet:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>A dear Dream Goddess on a crescent moon;</p>
<p class='line0'>An opalescent splendour like a noon</p>
<p class='line0'>Of lilies; and I wonder that the height</p>
<p class='line0'>Should darken for the depth to give me light—</p>
<p class='line0'>Light of your face, so lovely that I swoon</p>
<p class='line0'>With gazing, and then wake to find how soon</p>
<p class='line0'>Joy of the world fades when you fade from sight.</p>
<p class='line0'>Beholding you I am Endymion,</p>
<p class='line0'>Lost and immortal in Latmian dreams;</p>
<p class='line0'>With Dian bending down to look upon</p>
<p class='line0'>Her shepherd, whose aeonian slumber seems</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span></p>

<p class='line0'>And Death had thought to touch you with his doom,</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his exquisitely wrought, sensuously colored, yet
spiritually elevating verse surely we discover something
that has never before been in Canadian poetry. It is a
fresh achievement in Canadian poetry, even though it is
not always impeccable in rhythm and rhyme. It is, too,
authentic poetry, as if Dante or Keats or Tennyson or
Swinburne had returned to earth and their genius were
reincarnated, in a notable degree, in the genius of Robert
Norwood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Katherine Hale (Mrs. John Garvin) is a poet by herself.
For she was a poet of considerable distinction for a decade
before she published the volume which revealed her as
having found her métier in creative poetry, as in her <span class='it'>Morning
in the West</span> (1923). The eye and the ear are supreme
in her processes of perception. Music and pictorial art
were her first aesthetic loves, and had most to do with
determining her attitudes and appreciations of the spiritual
world. So that, at length, the inner eye and the inner ear
became the faculties by which she perceived beauty in the
external world as well as in the heart of mankind. All her
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
reactions to what she saw and heard in the external world
were in terms of color beauty and tonal beauty, perhaps
more in terms of color than of tone. She became a musical
critic of distinction, and one of our foremost ‘color-writers.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, therefore, Katherine Hale felt the ‘urge’ to
create poetry, her reactions to the spiritual world also were
in terms of color and music. It is found that her development
in poetic writing follows the same order as her development
in prose writing. She began as a critic of music
and reviewer of literature, but capped all her prose with a
finished and arresting work in ‘color-writing,’ <span class='it'>Canadian
Cities of Romance</span> (1922). She began her poetic creation
with the musical or lyrical qualities of her verse much more
accentuated than the color qualities, and her themes and
forms much more earth-born and conventional than romantic
and spiritualized in meaning. But always in her
first three books of verse there was the feeling for pictorial
or color values and for subtle emotional and spiritual
nuances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, as in <span class='it'>Morning in the West</span>, her latest volume,
she found her true mode, and poetry became for her the
beautiful sketching and etching and painting of the romance
of the Canadian spirit. This poetry of the spirit she suffused
with all the subtle variations of imaginative ‘color,’
half-lights, shadows, and chiaroscuro of Nature and social
life in Canada from the days of the Scots factor and Western
<span class='it'>chevalerie</span> to the era of the transcontinental railways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her first two books of verse, <span class='it'>Grey Knitting</span> (1914) and
<span class='it'>The White Comrade</span> (1916), by their very titles suggest the
color ‘note.’ But the gift or power of embodying spiritual
beauty in lyrical music is always uppermost, as for instance
in <span class='it'>The Ultimate Hour</span> or <span class='it'>In Noonday</span> containing the unforgettable
alliterative and musical line:—</p>

to make a dramatic picture that enthralls the mystical or
religious imagination. Her rare gifts of delicate fancy,
elfin enchantment from Nature and simple Orphean music,
reminding us of Bliss Carman’s light lyrism, is finely exemplified
in her spiritualized lyric <span class='it'>I Used to Wear a Gown
of Green</span>, in which beauty and pathos are tenderly commingled:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these—the poetry of her first three books, <span class='it'>Grey
Knitting</span>, <span class='it'>The White Comrade</span>, and <span class='it'>The New Joan</span>—were
but her short flights preparatory to making her eagle flight,
by which she should discover the meaning of Canadian
history and civilization in which is envisaged the Canadian
national spirit. In <span class='it'>Morning in the West</span> Katharine Hale
is no longer the individual lyrist fluting in the band of
other Canadian lyrists. In that volume she sounds the
diapason of Canadian nationality. She invents new forms
of lyrism, and her themes are colored with new tones and
lights of an impressionism which is the acme of realism and
yet is finely spiritualized, as in the series of verbal color-sketches
<span class='it'>Going North</span> and <span class='it'>A Study of Shadows</span>. But always
we are being taken by the poet through Canada, and
made to see what has been for us the most invisible, or, if
visible, the most elusive of all things, namely, the forms
and variation of the Canadian spirit and habitat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new forms of her lyrism may be exemplified in this
example, <span class='it'>Enchantment</span>:—</p>

<p class='line0'>And the answering call</p>
<p class='line0'>Far, far away,</p>

<p class='line0'>Oh, she would stay</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her new themes and new vision and spiritual import in
them—the envisagement of the qualities of the Canadian
spirit—are notably presented in <span class='it'>Cun-ne-wa-bum</span>, <span class='it'>Buffalo
Meat</span>, and most poignantly in <span class='it'>An Old Lady</span>, which is an
incisively graphic and dramatic <span class='it'>picture</span> of the whole history
of Canadian civilization from the early days of the Hudson’s
Bay Company to the 20th century social life in Ottawa
in these days of automobiles and bridge parties. Yet
it is no mere picture, but possesses a simple pathos, tenderness,
and wistfulness which spiritualize the realism in the
poem, and raise it to the plane of literature. This, then,
is Katherine Hale’s novel contribution to the poetic literature
of Canada:—Canadian nature and civilization envisaged
with a spiritual realism which has national perspective
and native color and atmosphere. It is a new and
distinct achievement in creative poetry in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another significant poet of the Second Renaissance
period, whose verse deserves special mention, is Lloyd
Roberts. Early in 1914 he published a volume of verse
entitled, <span class='it'>England Over Seas</span>. Lloyd Roberts is the son of
Charles G. D. Roberts. No doubt, he inherited his poetic
gifts from his father, and, no doubt, learned the principles
of technical artistry from him. But, as a matter of fact,
in his own published verse, Lloyd Roberts shows qualities—love
of Nature and the gift of a singularly lyrical lilt—that
are nearer the verse of his father’s cousin, the inimitable
lyrist of the seasons, the vagrom heart, and the open road,
Bliss Carman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>England Over Seas</span>, the younger Roberts is an enchanting
lover of Nature, a vivid colorist, and a melodious
verbal musician. Nature is, in his own phrase, ‘the star’—always
the theme and in the foreground. Of his qualities
as a nature-painter and a verbal melodist, the following is
an excellent example:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The number of the poets of the Second Renaissance is
legion. Amongst them are Arthur S. Bourinot, Gertrude
Bartlett, Bernard F. Trotter (deceased), Arthur L. Phelps,
Lucy M. Montgomery-MacDonald, Grace Blackburn,
Beatrice Redpath, Laura E. McCully, Louise Morey Bowman,
Florence Randal Livesay, Norah Holland, Amy
Pennington, Carroll C. Aikins, Wm. A. Creelman, Andrew
D. Merkel, Alexander Louis Fraser, Peter MacLaren
MacDonald, Clare Giffen, Erica Selfridge, Charles T.
Bruce, Marian Osborne, H. J. Maclean. It were worth
while to review in detail the work of Arthur S. Bourinot
as represented in his <span class='it'>Laurentian Lyrics</span> (1915), and
<span class='it'>Lyrics From the Hills</span> (1923), and Arthur L. Phelps as
represented in his <span class='it'>Poems</span> (1921) and <span class='it'>A Bobcaygeon Chapbook</span>
(1923). Bourinot attracted attention by his noble
and moving sonnet <span class='it'>To The Memory of Rupert Brooke</span> and
his tender and musical war lyric beginning:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>But he is also an artist in colorful lyrism of Nature in
Canada, especially of the Laurentian district. Phelps is
a refined, perhaps it were better to say, dainty lyrist; but
he has also attempted new forms, and has been successful
with realistic ‘free verse.’ The others, with a few exceptions,
are systematic poets, but are not notable for
spiritual vision or for originality in forms or substance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, however, from the point of view of a fresh vision
of earth and life and of originality in forms and substance
that the work of Florence Randal Livesay, Grace Blackburn,
Beatrice Redpath, Louise Morey Bowman, and Wilson
MacDonald must be specially remarked. For their
work displays a distinct advance in modernism over the
work of Marjorie Pickthall, Robert Norwood, and Katherine
Hale (earlier manner). In fact, there is in their work
fresh origination in themes, structures, music, and social
ideals. Florence Randal Livesay won distinction by her
<span class='it'>Songs of Ukraina</span> (1916). Though formally called translations,
they have such original elements of form and
matter that they are no more translations in the ordinary
meaning than is Fitzgerald’s <span class='it'>Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</span>.
Mrs. Livesay’s work in the <span class='it'>Songs of Ukraina</span>, like that of
Fitzgerald, has a turning of phrase and of imagery and a
grace and music which are all her own and entitle the <span class='it'>Songs</span>
to the distinction of creative verse. In 1923 she published
<span class='it'>Shepherd’s Purse</span>. Here her genius flowered independently
in what is essentially spiritual realism. But it is not a
heavy spiritual realism. It exhibits a rare and light fancy
for elusive emotional nuances; and all the poems have a
piquancy, daintiness, and exquisite humanity which win one
to the love of the evanescent beauty that is in all things
human. The poems too have an air of the qualities which
are in the <span class='it'>vers de société</span> and the ‘Blue China’ poetry of
Andrew Lang and Austin Dobson. Mrs. Livesay has made
a genuinely novel contribution to Canadian poetry.
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Outstanding in other ways is the verse of Grace Blackburn,
Beatrice Redpath, Louise Morey Bowman, and Wilson
MacDonald. There is more strength and spiritual
perceptiveness in the poetry of Grace Blackburn and
Beatrice Redpath than in that of Louise Morey Bowman.
All show equal originality and finish in the technical treatment
of their themes, but Louise Morey Bowman shows at
times an airy fancy which is almost so ethereal as to be
altogether abstract and unearthly. On the whole, exquisite
technique is their chief distinction; they are artists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilson MacDonald in his <span class='it'>Songs of the Prairie Land</span>
(1918) and <span class='it'>The Miracle Songs of Jesus</span> (1921) discloses
an absorption in mystical psychology and psychoanalysis
which, by its daring and his method of suffusing the matter
with ingenious and subtilized novelty or beauty of diction
and imagery, adumbrates Goethe of the <span class='it'>Faust</span> tradition.
It is at once realistic and ultra-spiritualistic. His technique
is just as original and individualized as the matter of his
poems. If any Canadian has the right to the distinction of
possessing <span class='it'>sheer</span> creative genius, that right belongs to Wilson
MacDonald as a Seer and as an Artist working in a
field of spiritual vision which he has pre-empted.</p>

<h4>1. <span class='it'>The Community Novel.</span></h4>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>U</span><span class='sc'>ntil</span> the ‘nineties’ the production of Canadian fiction
had been spasmodic and scattered, but the success of
Gilbert Parker, Marshall Saunders, and other Canadian
writers who gained a hearing first in lands alien to their
own, and whose work came back to Canada ‘with an alienated
majesty,’ proved that Canada was rich in literary
material. The first decade of the twentieth century saw a
marked increase in fiction writing in Canada. The new
writers were influenced not only by the example of their
compatriots but by that of the fiction writers of Great
Britain and the United States. They began to realize that
life around them was as interesting as Barrie’s Thrums or
Bret Harte’s California. There was, too, a growing reading
public ready to appreciate stories that presented the
adventure, the humor, and the pathos of the daily life of
themselves, their neighbors, or their fellow-Canadians in
other parts of the country and sometimes of other racial
origins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence arose the Community Novel or type of story. One
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>
of the earlier examples is Adeline M. Teskey’s <span class='it'>Where the
Sugar Maple Grows</span> (1901). In telling of the origin of
this book, Miss Teskey wrote that when reading Ian MacLaren’s
<span class='it'>Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush</span> she said within herself,
‘I know just as interesting people in Canada.’ Her
sketches of village characters, depicted with a homely but
effective simplicity of style, showed that she was right. A
delightfully humorous novel of Cranfordian flavor, <span class='it'>The
Specimen Spinster</span>, by Kate Westlake Yeigh, (1906), essayed
a larger canvas instead of the smaller etchings and
gave an insight into the social relationships of the rural
village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The year 1908 may be said to mark the real beginning of
the Second Renaissance in Canadian fiction, for in that
year there were published three novels of the Community
type—<span class='it'>Anne of Green Gables</span>, by L. M. Montgomery;
<span class='it'>Duncan Polite</span>, by Marian Keith; <span class='it'>Sowing Seeds in Danny</span>,
by Nellie L. McClung. There appeared also a charming
collection of short tales, <span class='it'>Little Stories of Quebec</span>, by James
Le Rossignol. This date is still further significant as the
year in which Marjorie Pickthall published her first important
short story, <span class='it'>La Tristesse</span>, in <span class='it'>The Atlantic Monthly</span>,
although her work differs greatly in setting and artistic
method from the fiction of the Community type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>L. M. Montgomery was born at Clifton, Prince Edward
Island, and spent her childhood in Cavendish, a seashore
farming settlement which figures as ‘Avonlea’ in her stories.
That her life has been spent chiefly within the limits of the
little island province and the bounds of an Ontario country
parish does not narrow her outlook although she confines
herself to themes bounded by rural experiences, for her
forte is the portrayal of what she has seen and knows. She
has imaginative and creative gifts, but she uses these in
enabling us to see the beauty, the humour, and the pathos
that lies about our daily paths.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Anne of Green Gables</span>, her first novel, has an interesting
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
history. Upon being asked for a short serial story for
a Sunday School weekly, she cast about for a plot idea. A
faded note book entry suggested: ‘Elderly couple apply to
orphan asylum for a boy; a girl is sent to them.’ The
writing of a serial was started, but time did not allow the
author to complete it for the purpose intended. As she
brooded over the theme it began to expand and the result
was a book which may be confidently labelled a ‘Canadian
classic.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Anne we have an entirely new character in fiction,
a high-spirited, sensitive girl, with a wonderfully vivid
imagination; wise beyond her years, outspoken and daring:
not always good but always lovable. Her longing for a
real home, and an interest in her very quaintness, ends in
her being established as a member of the Green Gables
family. It is Anne who dominates the whole story. There
are other characters, quaint too, and well-drawn, but the
introduction of Anne into the community—Anne, so unconventional
so imaginative, and so altogether different
from the staid, prosaic, general attitude of the neighbourhood—proves
to be the invasion of a peculiar ferment, and
the incidents which discover the process of fermentation
are most delightfully odd and mirth-provoking.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Anne of Avonlea</span> follows the career of the orphan heroine
and deals with two eventful years of school teaching.
Miss Montgomery understands children thoroughly and
makes her child characters of all types perfectly natural and
lifelike. The same creative faculty which gave us in
Anne an entirely new shadow-child shows itself in the portrayal
of the mischievous but lovable Davy Keith, his
demure twin sister Dora, the imaginative Paul Irving, and
the many individualities of the pupils of Avonlea School.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Plot interest is not a strong feature of this or of any of
L. M. Montgomery’s novels. There are, nevertheless,
several threads of action which bind together the series of
incidents and secure continuity and unity. The nature
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>
descriptions reveal at once the author’s intimacy with
nature and her poetic attitude of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is a typical passage:—</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>A September day on Prince Edward Island hills; a crisp wind blowing
up over the sand dunes from the sea; a long, red road, winding
through fields and woods, now looping itself about a corner of thick
set spruce, now threading a plantation of young maples with great
feathery sheets of ferns beneath them, now dipping down into a hollow
where a brook flashed out of the woods and into them again, now
basking in the open sunshine between ribbons of goldenrod and of
myriads of crickets.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Chronicles of Avonlea</span>, a volume of short stories, contains
some of her most finished work, showing that perfect
art that conceals all art, and abounding in a strong vein of
simple humour that is found in all her work.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Story Girl</span> and <span class='it'>The Golden Road</span> are written with
even less attention to a central plot than the earlier ‘Anne’
books. They are somewhat loosely connected series of incidents
in which the same characters take part. But the
community type of fiction does not demand thrilling plots.
Other writers can write plot stories, but most other writers
do not hold before us the mirror of Canadian country life.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Kilmeny of the Orchard</span> is in a sense but an expanded
short story. It is a prose love idyll and does not, perhaps,
bulk very large when compared with the other books. It
is really one of the extended ‘chronicles’ of Avonlea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story of Anne Shirley continues through several
volumes—<span class='it'>Anne of the Island</span> pictures her college days;
<span class='it'>Anne’s House of Dreams</span> sees her established as mistress
of her own home; while <span class='it'>Rilla of Ingleside</span> carries over the
history into the second generation, Rilla being the daughter
of Anne. There is no new development of method or treatment
in these. In <span class='it'>Emily of New Moon</span> (1923) Miss
Montgomery created a new child character, with a new
environment, new conditions, and a new group of minor
personages, yet in effect it is of the same type and in the
same literary field as her previous novels. The chief difference
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>
to be observed is that she employs a more analytic
psychological method in depicting her heroine—a method
that tends to produce an adult’s story of youth. In a way
it marks an advance in literary technique but is not as yet
entirely divorced from that minute objective observation
which makes equal appeal to the young in years and the
young in heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The particular type of rural community which is the
background of Marian Keith’s stories may be duplicated in
many parts of Canada and is quite common in older Ontario—a
community originally settled by Scottish Presbyterians
and afterwards leavened with just enough English
and Irish to throw into relief the chief characteristics of
each nationality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One cannot escape the fact of a marked similarity to
the work of J. M. Barrie in his tales of Thrums. There
is, however, this difference: Barrie is more restrained in
his emotions, more abbreviated and less poetic in his
descriptions, more pawky and less boisterous in his humor;
in fine, Barrie is Scotch, Marian Keith is Scottish-Canadian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in most novels of the community type, the interest
lies in incident and characterization. The noblest character
of all her stories, the best drawn, is the grand old mystic
Highlander, ‘Duncan Polite,’ the spiritual watchman of
Glenoro. The incidents of this story are woven mainly
around the path of the young minister, while the other
Glenoro novels centre about the personages of chief interest
in a rural community—<span class='it'>Silver Maple</span>, the school teacher;
<span class='it'>Treasure Valley</span>, the young doctor. <span class='it'>The End of the Rainbow</span>
and <span class='it'>The Bells of St. Stephens</span> are studies of town life.
<span class='it'>Lizbeth of the Dale</span> and <span class='it'>In Orchard Glen</span> are character
studies of a boy and a girl respectively. The same qualities
prevail in all these. <span class='it'>Little Miss Melody</span> builds an engaging
picture of the community of Cherry Hill around a fresh
and original young girl character. The keynote of Marian
Keith’s stories is ‘service.’ Her work as a whole gives a
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
faithful picture of the social and religious life of a certain
type of rural Canadian settlement, and Canadian town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. McClung’s ‘community’ depicted in <span class='it'>Sowing Seeds
in Danny</span> was a little western town, with certain elements
of the usual population crossing its pages. The poor immigrant
girl, the young English gentleman learning to
farm, the doctor, the preacher, the would-be politician are
faithfully portrayed. Most interesting of all is Mrs. Watson,
the hard-working washerwoman and her family of
nine children. The fortunes of Pearlie Watson are the
theme of a sequel, <span class='it'>The Second Chance</span>, in which the setting
in a rural settlement, while <span class='it'>The Black Creek Stopping
House</span> is a collection of short stories. Later the career of
Pearl Watson is continued in <span class='it'>Purple Springs</span>, but this novel
shades into a sort of politico-propagandist treatise. Human
interest and news quality with a ready-made style to correspond
has caught the public interest in Mrs. McClung’s
work rather than any conspicuous artistry of method.</p>

<h4>2. <span class='it'>The Institutional Novel.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>From looking at the life of fixed communities or localities,
the next step is to consider them in their relation to
what we might call certain ‘institutions’ of our national
life, growth, or conditions. We saw that R. E. Knowles
in <span class='it'>St. Cuthbert’s</span> made the Scottish Presbyterian Church
the dominating influence of that story. In this sense, the
life of the railroad or construction camp is an ‘institutional’
rather than a local or community life. This has been excellently
portrayed by Frank L. Packard in his collection
of short stories, <span class='it'>On the Iron at Big Cloud</span>: Alan Sullivan’s
<span class='it'>The Passing of Oul-I-But</span> contains some splendid stories
of this type. Here also we would place the sea stories of
Norman Duncan and Frederick William Wallace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norman Duncan’s peculiar field is the ragged coasts
and savage seas of Newfoundland and the hard, cruel,
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>
tempest-battered life of the Newfoundland fisherman.
When <span class='it'>The Way of the Sea</span> was published (1904), Frank
T. Bullen, himself a master-maker of sea stories, wrote in a
foreword: ‘I am absolutely certain that with the exception of
Joseph Conrad and Rudyard Kipling no writing about the
sea has ever probed so deeply and so faithfully into its
mysteries as his.’ Duncan’s fidelity to his subject appears
not only in his truthful description of the life and way of
the sea, but even more in his realization and presentation
of the religious side of the Newfoundland fishermen—whose
stern creed was born out of a never-ceasing struggle
for existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Norman Duncan, although he produced several novels,
of which <span class='it'>Dr. Luke of the Labrador</span> is the most artistically
constructed, is essentially a writer of short stories. Indeed,
some of his novels were made simply by piecing together,
with connecting material, stories that had first appeared in
magazine form. As a short story writer he exhibits the
finest and most desirable qualities—substantial character
foundation, economy of language, sufficiency of emotional
causation, and a breadth of human sympathy. His <span class='it'>Battles
Royal Down North</span> and <span class='it'>Harbor Tales Down North</span> are two
collections of a high order of excellence. His power to
portray action makes his juvenile books—such as <span class='it'>Billy
Topsail and Company</span>—very acceptable to the youthful
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frederick William Wallace writes chiefly of Nova Scotia
sailors and deep sea fishermen. He is more objective in his
treatment of themes than is Duncan. While Wallace’s gift
may be said to lie in his skill in producing vivid visualizations
of seamanship, Duncan’s lies in realizing seamen.
Wallace observes and describes the life of the sailor and
the fisherman; Duncan realizes and interprets the soul.
Consequently in <span class='it'>Blue Water</span> (1920), <span class='it'>The Shacklocker</span> (a
collection of short stories), and <span class='it'>The Viking Blood</span>, have
much more plot and action to them than have Norman Duncan’s
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>
novels and short stories; but they are not so intimate
and convincing in character analysis, neither are they so
careful nor so finished in their technique—the two styles are
quite in harmony with the differing methods of treatment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Commercial life in its sociological relationships falls under
our definition of an ‘institutional’ aspect of national
life. Here must be placed Alan Sullivan’s <span class='it'>The Inner Door</span>
which reveals inside conditions and labor problems in connection
with the operation of a large rubber factory; also
his story of the somewhat spectacular development of a
chain of allied industries at a strategic point for power and
for raw material—told in <span class='it'>The Rapids</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are, in this period, some notable examples of Incidental
Literature. Louis Hémon, a native of France,
lived but a short time in Canada, yet wrote, in <span class='it'>Maria Chapdelaine</span>,
(English translations by W. H. Blake and by Sir
Andrew Macphail), a chastely poetic novel of French
Canadian life. Miss J. G. Sime in <span class='it'>Our Little Life</span> presents,
if we view it from one angle, a meticulous study of
the life of a Montreal seamstress, with her pathetically frustrate
love story; but more than all that, <span class='it'>Our Little Life</span>
is an observation of the life of the Canadian people by an
English mind. The literary artistry of both these works
is indisputable. Some criticism has been aimed at both on
the score of inaccuracy of minor facts. Whether or not
there are such minor inaccuracies, there still remains the
grand result that the color, the atmosphere, the outward
semblance, are portrayed as they have scarce ever been
before; that the inmost soul of the characters is understandingly
and consistently revealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Education in its institutional aspect appears in many
novels only incidentally. As a dominant motive or a circumscribing
setting its development is comparatively recent.
<span class='it'>Miriam of Queen’s</span>, by Lilian Vaux Mackinnon (1921),
shows the molding influence of university life; <span class='it'>The Hickory
Stick</span>, by Nina Moore Jamieson (1921), emphasises
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>
the place and importance of the rural school in rural life
and problems; the great school novels of English literature
find a modified echo in the boarding school stories of Ethel
Hume Bennett and Gordon Hill Grahame—<span class='it'>Judy of York
Hill</span> (1922), by the former, in which dialogue, action and
atmosphere contribute effectively in conveying a picture of
a girls’ school; <span class='it'>Larry, or the Avenging Terrors</span> (1923),
by the latter, a boys’ boarding school story of lively
incident.</p>

<h4>3. <span class='it'>The Realistic Romance.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>The rapid expansion of the far West and such spectacular
events as the ‘Klondike rush,’ gave a sort of feverish
color to a life that previously had appeared one of toil,
hardship, and stony endurance. Viewed imaginatively,
that life now presented its hectic side, and the far West
and the high North were exploited as literary fields of thrill,
adventure, and excitement. Thus the second decade of
this century saw the rise in Canada of the Realistic Romance.
At its best this class of novel resembles the Community
type but is speeded up with a more exciting and
more complicated plot; at its worst it is lurid melodrama
with realism interpreted as the portrayal of the sordid and
seamy side of life. Very few of the realistic romances
exhibit any distinction of manner and style. They are not
concerned with the niceties of the art of telling a story but
with the ability to keep the reader constantly keyed up to a
high emotional tensity.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Trail of ’98</span>, by Robert W. Service (1910), is a
story of the Yukon, with the spectacular elements of gold-rush
days fully emphasised. The qualities of Service’s
poetry are accentuated in his fiction. In the same year H.
A. Cody began his career as a novelist with another Yukon
tale, <span class='it'>The Frontiersman</span>. It is a story of love, adventure,
and missionary experience. <span class='it'>Rod of the Lone Patrol</span> followed
in 1912, adding a new fictional element which has
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>
been much exploited—the doings of the North West
Mounted Police. Cody produced a long series of adventure
novels with a variety of settings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other writers of the Realistic Romance speedily developed
different aspects of Western life or staged their
romances in different regions of the Great West or the Far
North. We have room only for brief mention of some of
the best known writers in this class.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Stead’s novels are chiefly of the prairie farm
and ranch—<span class='it'>The Bail Jumper</span> (1914), <span class='it'>The Homesteader</span>,
<span class='it'>The Cowpuncher</span>, <span class='it'>Dennison Grant</span>, <span class='it'>Neighbors</span>. He is effective
in reproducing the atmosphere of the prairie, the
details of farm and ranch life, and characteristic bits of
scenery; his stories are stronger in incident and action than
they are in characterization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Watson began fairly well with <span class='it'>My Brave and
Gallant Gentleman</span> (1918), a romance of England and
British Columbia, that had touches of Borrow and Stevenson,
but his later efforts have tended to cast themselves into
more stereotyped forms. Robert A. Hood produced two
adventure-romances of British Columbia, <span class='it'>The Chivalry of
Keith Leicester</span> and <span class='it'>The Quest of Alistair</span>. Douglas Durkin
exploited Manitoba in <span class='it'>The Lobstick Trail</span>. ‘Luke
Allan’ (Lacey Amy) wrote several stories of cowboy life of
which <span class='it'>Blue Pete: Half Breed</span> was significant because of the
originality and individuality of its leading character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Murray Gibbon’s earlier fiction—in <span class='it'>Drums Afar</span>
and <span class='it'>Hearts and Faces</span>—was English in its setting and concerned
with psychological problems and studies of Oxford
life. In transferring to an American literary habitat, he
entered the ranks of the Realistic Romancers. His novel,
<span class='it'>The Conquering Hero</span>, was a lively, melodramatic story of
the Rocky Mountains and British Columbia ranches; while
in <span class='it'>Pagan Love</span> (1923), he combined a startling mystery
with an element of satire on the modern philosophy of
business success.
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Theodore Goodridge Roberts, younger brother of
Charles G. D. Roberts, is essentially a story teller and much
of his fiction shows the influence of Weyman and the historical
romanticists of the latter years of the nineteenth
century. His <span class='it'>Brothers in Peril</span> (1905), <span class='it'>A Captain of
Raleigh’s</span> (1911), and <span class='it'>The Harbor Master</span> (1914) are
stories of romantic adventure of very early days in Newfoundland,
while <span class='it'>Jess of the River</span>, <span class='it'>Rayton</span> and <span class='it'>Forest
Fugitives</span> have a setting in rural New Brunswick.</p>

<h4>4. <span class='it'>Historical Fiction.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>The influences that produced the Community Novel
gave to the Historical Fiction of this period a closer up
view. Instead of the far-off days of the French regime,
the historical field of vision became that of but a century
or so past and writers essayed to revivify the times and
personages of the War of 1812 or the Rebellion of 1837.
A noteworthy example is C. H. J. Snider’s stories of the
naval engagements on the Great Lakes, <span class='it'>In the Wake of the
Eighteen-Twelvers</span>. With fine recreative imagination he
enables us to live through incidents of daring, gallantry,
and romance of these stirring battles. ‘Anison North’ in
<span class='it'>The Forging of the Pikes</span> gives a realistic picture of Toronto
of ’37, of the battle of Montgomery’s Tavern, and a
pen-portrait of the rebel leader, Mackenzie. She lets us
see ‘both sides of the story’ of the conditions that were responsible
for the Rebellion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A minor species of the Historical Novel is found in
the novel of pioneer life which seeks to put into a permanent
record pioneer experiences and conditions of sometimes
considerably less than a century ago. Adeline M.
Teskey did this for the Niagara Peninsula and the building
of the first Welland Canal with <span class='it'>In Candlelight Days</span>
(1914). Archie McKishnie told of the conflict of the
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
‘bushwhacker,’ who delighted in the freedom of the woods
and streams, with the incoming tide of settlement in <span class='it'>Love
of the Wild</span>, drawing upon the historic figure of Colonel
Talbot for some of his characterization. Anison North
blends a colorful picture of the enjoyment of outdoor life
with a pioneer line fence feud in her <span class='it'>Carmichael</span>. In <span class='it'>Kinsmen</span>
Percival J. Cooney relates a strange story of Scottish
feudalism—an example of the clan system with its autocratic
laird—which actually existed in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few Canadian writers have found leisure to follow the
example of Gilbert Parker in writing Historical Fiction in
Old World settings, but this has quite recently been done
in a highly distinctive style in novels appearing over the
signature—‘E. Barrington.’ <span class='it'>The Ladies</span>, semi-historical
stories of the eighteenth century; <span class='it'>The Chaste Diana</span>, a story
of Polly Peacham of ‘Beggar’s Opera’ fame; <span class='it'>The Divine
Lady</span> (1924) tells the love-story of Lord Nelson and Emma
Hamilton.</p>

<h4>5. <span class='it'>Imaginative Fiction.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>In one sense all fiction is imaginative. There is, however,
a species in which pure imagination plays a much
greater part than in the Community Novel, in Historical
Fiction, or in the other types discussed in this chapter.
Marjorie Pickthall’s work is the highest example of this.
She wrote, not with the reproductive imagination
nor with fancy, but with the faculty defined by
Matthew Arnold as imaginative reason. Into the texture
of her fiction she wove poetic imagination and poetic significance
derived from her clear, absolute, and sympathetic
understanding of the human heart and of the hidden
springs and the meaning of existence, from her superior
and inclusive sympathetic intelligence. Thus she was enabled
to write stories of the most varied settings and of the
most wildly differing characters with equal convincingness.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Little Hearts</span> (1915), is an engaging tale of the days
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>
of ‘Bonnie Prince Charlie’ with its conflict chiefly between
loyalty to the Crown, and fidelity to the spirit of humanity.
It pictures ‘little hearts,’ men of small fortunes, and small
(as the world sees it) ambitions, in their pathetic existence,
more pathetic because of finely brave in the midst of many
both petty and heroic vicissitudes of fortune, of mean victory
and noble defeat. The novel preaches no didactic
moral but it silently teaches Christ’s philosophy of struggle
and defeat—‘He that loseth his life shall find it.’ It impresses
unforgettably how little after all are the greatest
hearts, and how little we lose or gain in any defeat or
triumph which is merely earthly defeat or triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Bridge</span> (1922), has the same theme, with the pain
and cruelty of love, of unfulfilled seeking, and the final
triumph of a soul that saved itself by losing itself in inward
self-knowledge and self-sacrifice. It is set against
a background of the tremendous beauty of the Great Lakes,
scenes of storm on land and water. Technically, it is
farther from perfection than <span class='it'>Little Hearts</span>; it has less
structural unity, less smoothness of style. At times the
emotional situations seem overdrawn; nor are atmosphere
and setting definitively localized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The collection of short stories—<span class='it'>Angel’s Shoes</span> (1922)—embodies
examples of Miss Pickthall’s perfect artistry
as a short story writer. These stories are clear, vivid,
colorful, and of almost the highest type of creative
imagination. They may lack, occasionally, a warmth of
humanity that is present in the work of other writers of
poorer craftsmanship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Less distinctive but belonging to the few Canadian
novels of this class is <span class='it'>The Window Gazer</span>, by Isabel Ecclestone
Mackay, a romance of a man who ‘fell in love with
his wife.’ Blended with the characteristics of the novel of
pure imagination there are here slight touches of the
Realistic Romance and the Community Novel. A somewhat
curious literary phenomena is found in <span class='it'>Mists of the
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>
Morning</span> by this same writer, which began in the style of
the Imaginative Novel and ended as a Realistic Romance.</p>

<h4>6. <span class='it'>Some Miscellaneous Types.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>To the ranks of the Animal Romancers this period has
added at least one writer who approaches the subject in a
new way. The attitude was apparent in the nature passages
of <span class='it'>Gaff Linkum</span> (1907) and became more a quality
of Archie McKishnie’s work as he continued to write short
stories and novels of animal life. We find it crystallized
in <span class='it'>Openway</span> (1923). Roberts is the intellectual animal
psychologist; Thompson Seton, the literary scientist; W.
A. Fraser, the objective story teller; but Archie McKishnie
impresses us with the sense of his comradeship with the
creatures of the marsh, the wood, and the stream. He is their
interpreter but not as an outside observer. He lives with
them, loves them, protects them. Thus when he writes
animal stories he rises to his best literary style and achieves
a beauty and smoothness that is not always found in his
other writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The detective story is represented by a series of ‘underground’
stories by Arthur Stringer; a typical example is
<span class='it'>The Wire Tappers</span>. The setting is a large American city,
and rapidity of action is the desired and supplied element.
More Canadian in setting and atmosphere are Victor
Lauriston’s <span class='it'>The Twenty-First Burr</span> and Hopkins Moorhouse’s
<span class='it'>The Gauntlet of Alceste</span>, both well-constructed according
to the requirements of this type of fiction, concealing
the mystery motive skilfully up to a surprising climactic
finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The religions and philosophies of the Orient find a
slight reflection in some Canadian poetry. In fiction, the
stories and novels of L. Adams Beck—<span class='it'>The Ninth Vibration</span>,
<span class='it'>The Key of Dreams</span>, <span class='it'>The Perfume of the Rainbow</span>,
<span class='it'>The Treasure of Ho</span>—are chiefly Oriental in themes and
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>
settings, and mark the author as an interpreter of the mysteries
of the East, with an unusual beauty and originality
of style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur Stringer’s trilogy of the prairie—<span class='it'>The Prairie
Wife</span>, <span class='it'>The Prairie Mother</span>, <span class='it'>The Prairie Child</span>—is remarkable
as a study in feminine psychology and the reactions of
problems of prairie life upon a feminine mind in its domestic
and personal associations. The first volume in the trilogy
is the most impressive because of its spontaneity, its
subtle touches of color and atmosphere. The modern
double-triangle element dominates and rather detracts from
the originality and individuality of the latter volumes, but
the series is significant as an advance from the realistic
romance toward a newer realism.</p>

<h4>7. <span class='it'>The New Realism.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>It was but natural that a reaction should set in against
the realistic romance with its insufficiency of motivation
and its lack of fidelity to real life. Rather remarkably
this arrives in another ten-year cycle and a group of novels
published in 1923 show a marked similarity of method and
treatment, with widely varied themes and settings. We
distinguish this fresh and original attitude as the ‘New
Realism’ in Canadian fiction. The strongest of these novels
undoubtedly is <span class='it'>The Viking Heart</span> by Laura Goodman Salverson.
It might be called the epic of the Icelander in
Canada, describing as it does the arrival of a party of immigrants
in 1870 and following their struggles, hardships,
and gradual rise of fortunes to the present day. There is
no plot but such as grows out of the record of the lives of
the characters. There is no melodrama, but there is the
tense drama of the realities of life. The style is chaste,
simple, but forceful. Back of it all lies a big theme—‘the
price of country’—the realization of citizenship through
toil, tears, blood, and sacrifice.
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The other novels in this group are: <span class='it'>Possession</span>, by Mazo
de la Roche, with its setting a Niagara fruit farm; <span class='it'>Lantern
Marsh</span>, by Beaumont Cornell, following a farm boy
through his struggles for an education; <span class='it'>Cattle</span>, by Onoto
Watanna, an almost brutally realistic presentation of a man
whose sole aim in life was the acquirement of cattle—as a
form of wealth—whose whole outlook on life was measured
in terms of cattle; <span class='it'>The Child’s House</span>, by Marjory MacMurchy,
which enters into the heart and mind of a growing
little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The importance of this movement is that it has cast
aside superficialities, that these writers have somehow been
able to ‘see things as they are,’ to glimpse the realities of
life from their real beginnings—four of the five novels
named are actually rooted in ‘the soil’ as their setting and
their underlying spiritual foundation. With this foundation
of actuality and truth, the writers have gained a clearer
and more finished expression. Some of these novels have
melodramatic spots; some have other weaknesses, but, on
the whole, the effect of this new movement has been to produce
novels that have a definite structural unity, that are
largely free from irrelevant and insignificant detail, that
are written with an economy and aptness of language, and
that have more definiteness and depth to their basic themes.</p>

<h3>The Poetic Dramatists</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>THE POETIC DRAMATISTS OF THE SECOND RENAISSANCE—ARTHUR
STRINGER—ROBERT NORWOOD—MARJORIE
PICKTHALL, AND OTHERS.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span><span class='sc'>rthur stringer</span>, novelist and lyric poet, showed
versatility and considerable power in imaginative
construction when, in 1903, he published a volume of two
dramatic poems or soliloquies and one poetic drama, all on
classical themes in blank verse; namely, <span class='it'>Hephaestus</span>, <span class='it'>Persephone
at Enna</span>, and <span class='it'>Sappho in Leucadia</span>. In these works,
however, Stringer was indulging an ‘avocation;’ for his
genius is at its best in lyrical verse and prose fiction.
<span class='it'>Hephaestus</span> and <span class='it'>Persephone</span>, even though they are written
in blank verse, have all the color, music, and emotion which
we associate with lyrical poetry. <span class='it'>Sappho in Leucadia</span>,
though dramatic in form, is undramatic in movement, and
is lyrical in spirit. For at the beginning Sappho, the ‘bird-throated
child of Lesbos,’ has resolved to destroy herself
by leaping into the sea, and Phaon’s only role is the attempt
of a lover to dissuade her, but to no avail. The so-called
‘drama’ is but a series of colloquies between Sappho and
Phaon. The only ‘movement’ is a psychological development
in three stages—first, the original intention on
Sappho’s part to destroy herself; then the arrested intention;
and, finally, the intention fulfilled, in spite of Phaon’s
pleading, by Sappho leaping to her death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Stringer has really done in <span class='it'>Sappho in Leucadia</span>
is to take a Greek legend and to tell the simple episode of
Sappho’s death, in colorful, musical, and artistic blank
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>
verse. There is no emotional poignancy in it; nothing for
the heart and the moral imagination. It is all for the
aesthetic sensibility, for the lover of sensuous imagery and
melody. Oddly its single lyrical interlude or ‘song’ is not
in ‘Sapphics,’ but is an octave in trimeters. The sensuous
beauty of color and music in this quasi-poetic drama is
exemplified in the following speech by Sappho:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>For like a god you seemed in those glad days</p>
<p class='line0'>Of droning wings and languorous afternoons,</p>
<p class='line0'>When close beside the murmuring sea we walked.</p>
<p class='line0'>Then did the odorous summer ocean seem</p>
<p class='line0'>A meadow green where foam one moment flowered</p>
<p class='line0'>And then was gone, and ever came again,</p>

<p class='line0'>The bloom of youth was on your sunburnt cheek,</p>
<p class='line0'>The streams of life sang thro’ your violet veins,</p>
<p class='line0'>The midnight velvet of your tangled hair</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Stringer’s <span class='it'>Sappho in Leucadia</span> is an engaging and even
impressive dramatic colloquy, but it is not an authentic
poetic or closet drama. It has sensuous beauty but no
spiritual power. But it does increase Stringer’s reputation
as a verbal colorist and melodist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1915 appeared an original poet of distinct spiritual
power in lyrical and dramatic forms. He was Robert
Norwood. His first book was a sonnet-sequence. But in
1916 he published a poetic drama, <span class='it'>The Witch of Endor: A
Tragedy</span>; and in 1919, another poetic drama, <span class='it'>The Man of
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>
Kerioth</span>. In 1921 he published <span class='it'>Bill Boram</span>, which is a
‘dramatic tale.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert Norwood has two natural gifts. More than
any other Canadian poet he has an innate genius for the
philosophical or mystical interpretation of good and evil
in the universe. Also, he is gifted with acute insight into
the inner heart of man and woman, ancient and modern.
These two gifts fit him for the office of the kind of poet
who by imaginative sympathy perceives the ultimate harmony
of the universe, the spiritual meaning of the tragedy
and comedy of existence. As a poetic dramatist, then,
Norwood is a Seer; and his voice is the voice of a Prophet.
Power over the heart and imagination of the people, not
Beauty and Art for art’s sake, is his aim. If he is the Poet
of Beauty, as he is in all his verse, lyrical and dramatic,
he is more, or supremely, the Poet of Spiritual Vision and
Power in his poetic dramas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In <span class='it'>The Witch of Endor</span> Norwood returns to the Biblical
theme which had engaged Heavysege—the love romance
and tragedy of King Saul. The characters are never
shadowy but always alive. The dramatic movement is
never held up by long or digressive moralizing speeches,
as in Heayysege’s <span class='it'>Saul</span>, but each character makes his
speeches according to the dramatic necessity, enough and
no more, thus permitting at ‘the psychological moment’ the
natural entrance of another character and his speech. The
structure is logically developed to the tragic or spiritual
climax. But in the development there is no uniform level
of emotion, rather the emotion varies from gentle or
pathetic to intense or tragic. It is indeed in its profounder
imaginative vision, its more varying and rising degrees of
emotional intensity, and its more logical structural development
to a climax that <span class='it'>The Witch of Endor</span> has more
incisive and compelling power as poetic drama than Campbell’s
Arthurian drama <span class='it'>Mordred</span>. In short, <span class='it'>The Witch of
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>
Endor</span> is a beautiful and spiritual poetic drama—purging
the emotions of pity and fear and transporting the spirit to
the Mount of Vision where it sees intuitively how the ways
of God to man are justified and how Love is greater than
Faith and Hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his next poetic drama <span class='it'>The Man of Kerioth</span> (that is,
Judas Iscariot) Norwood made an advance in imaginative
vision, construction, and power. He achieves this by reducing
the magniloquence of the speeches and by modernly
humanizing the characters of Judas Iscariot, Mary Magdalen,
Blind Bartimaeus, Philip, and Jesus the Carpenter.
He even introduces little children into the drama. The
high and the vulgar and lowly, saints and sinners, the motley
of society in Jerusalem, commingle intimately and
humanly. There is a distinct advance in realistic truth
of characterization, and the whole drama is pervaded with
a winning naturalness and humanity which are not in any
preceding poetic drama by a Canadian, nor even in his
own succeeding ultra-realistic ‘dramatic tale of the sea,’
<span class='it'>Bill Boram</span>. So that in respect of creation thoroughly
humanized, noble, and clearly limned character-portraiture—as,
for instance, Judas Iscariot, Mary Magdalen, and
Jesus—Norwood must be ranked as the supreme creator
amongst Canadian poetic dramatists. This is a matter
of sheer artistry. But Norwood also shows an advance
in spiritual power. With profounder mystical vision and
greater truth he justifies the ways of God to man, and
exalts the spirit to the Temple pinnacle where we behold
Immortal Love in all its sweet beauty of humanity and in
all its white radiance of redeeming light. In <span class='it'>The Man of
Kerioth</span> he attains his acme in spiritual beauty and power
as a poetic dramatist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far Norwood had not created any poetic drama with
a definitively Canadian theme, setting, and characters. In
his <span class='it'>Bill Boram</span>, which is a ‘dramatic tale’ told in the third
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
person, the characters and the action being ‘reported,’ Norwood
made a fresh, novel, and impressive contribution to
original Canadian Literature. In doing so Norwood
dropped somewhat in imaginative truth and dramatic invention;
but he rose to greater heights of mystical perception
and spiritual power. The theme of <span class='it'>Bill Boram</span> is the
redemption of the human spirit by the love of beauty in
Nature. Ingenious as his conception is, Norwood committed
the error of conceiving the accident of a love of
flowers, that is to say, of sensuous beauty, as a possible
redemptive force in human life. He would have us believe
that the love of sensuous beauty can transmute itself or
become transmuted into an altogether different kind of
love, namely, the love of spiritual beauty and thus regenerate
a coarse and brutal nature and remake it into a noble
and refined spirit. Such spiritual metabolism is impossible,
and <span class='it'>Bill Boram</span> so far forth lacks imaginative truth and
dramatic power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aside from that, <span class='it'>Bill Boram</span>, on the whole, is a novel
achievement in dramatic narrative. The characters are
vividly and veraciously drawn; they have realistic truth.
There is also an air of romance in the whole tale, such an
air of vital romance as obtains in the tales and novels of
the sea by Norman Duncan and Frederick William Wallace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Summarily; Norwood’s <span class='it'>Bill Boram</span> is an amazing dramatic
picture of rude characters in a setting of romance
colored by a strange and startling commingling of coarse
speech and brutalized deed and of beautiful diction and
exquisite imagery. It is at once a <span class='it'>tour de force</span> in dramatic
conception and construction and in impressionistic word-painting.
Yet it is a powerful presentation of the idea of
the mystical union of the human spirit with the divine
through the love of pure beauty in Nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Second Renaissance is noted also for the work of
several other poetic dramatists. Amongst them are Dr.
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
James B. Dollard, author of <span class='it'>Clontarf: An Irish National
Drama</span>; Rev. Dean Llwyd, author of <span class='it'>The Vestal Virgin</span>;
John L. Carleton, author of <span class='it'>The Medieval Hun; A
Historical Drama</span>, and <span class='it'>The Crimson Wing</span>, which has
the distinction of having been the winner of the first prize
for original dramatic composition in the Canadian Prize
Play Competition, 1918; Norah Holland, author of <span class='it'>When
Half Gods Go and Other Poems</span> (1924), the title-poem of
which has been repeated as a Christmas play for several
successive seasons. These are all respectable poetic dramas
and give distinction both to the quantity and the quality of
poetic drama in the Second Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this work in poetic drama is, after all, not inspired
impressing one as a stint in creation, and is not at all
comparable to the work of Norwood in imaginative vision,
artistic construction, and dramatic power. Comparable,
however, with Norwood’s and superior to it in spiritual
poignancy is the single poetic drama left by Marjorie
Pickthall. Though Norwood’s poetic dramas contain
lyrical interludes, and though his dramatic tale <span class='it'>Bill Boram</span>
is for the most part rhymed, on the whole they are in blank
verse. But Miss Pickthall’s single poetic drama <span class='it'>The Wood
Carver’s Wife</span> is lyrical through and through, and is
properly to be denoted as ‘lyric drama.’ In form this lyric
drama stands midway between Stringer’s dramatic poems
and Norwood’s poetic dramas. In that respect Marjorie
Pickthall made a novel contribution to Canadian poetic
literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Wood Carver’s Wife</span> was first published in <span class='it'>The
University Magazine</span> in 1920. It was reprinted, along
with other fugitive poems, in 1922, the drama supplying
the title poem of the volume. <span class='it'>The Wood Carver’s Wife</span>
has four characters, one of whom is Shagonas, an Indian
lad who represents Nemesis. It is set in the time of the
Intendant. The theme is ‘the eternal triangle’—a girl-wife,
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
with a husband still alive and a secret lover. The mood
of the drama is the tragedy which follows the sin of disloyalty
to the sacrament of marriage, even if the disloyalty
is only in the heart and never openly expressed in clandestine
meeting between the wife and the lover. The mood
of the dramatist, however, is not one of simply illustrating
the law that the ‘soul that sinneth it shall die,’ but of wistfulness
about the ways of God to men and women when
spiritual unmating is permitted by Heaven. The dramatist
<span class='it'>seems</span> to put her own feeling about the matter into her
drama. She seems to feel that if the moral law is inexorable,
it ought not to be so in the case of a young girl
who innocently, or without knowing her own heart and
what she was doing, married a man, who, after all, did not
want her as an end in herself, or her spirit for its own
sake, but to have her as a model for the statue of the Blessed
Virgin he was creating in wood, as a chattel in his studio.
Humanly, Marjorie Pickthall felt that the girl-wife was
more sinned against than sinning when she allowed herself
to be conscious—merely conscious—of the lover. But
Marjorie Pickthall, with loyalty to the dramatic necessities,
though with a spiritual wistfulness all the while, constructed
the action and movement of <span class='it'>The Wood Carver’s Wife</span> so
that the tragic ending was inevitable. For the husband
knows that there is a secret lover, and Shagonas knows,
and at the tragic climax it is the arrow of the Indian, representing
the moral law, that sends the lover to his death.
The girl-wife knows what has happened, because she has
heard the twang of Shagonas’ bow-string. The tragedy
is complete when she receives from Shagonas, who is again
Nemesis, the sword of her lover, and dies with a mad speech
on her lips, while at the same time the husband, also mad,
as he was from the beginning, has Shagonas pose the beautiful
dead body of the girl-wife that he may put the acme
touches to his statue.
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>How easily the dramatist might have made certain
shifts which would have resulted in reconciliation and a
happy ending! But with all her spiritual wistfulness,
Marjorie Pickthall loyally held to the dramatic and the
artistic ideals. The climax and tragic ending are tremendous
and wholly spiritualizing, purging the soul with pity
for humanity through the terror which the action and the
denouement awake in the spirit. There is in it all a spiritual
poignancy which does not obtain in Norwood’s love-tragedy
of Saul in <span class='it'>The Witch of Endor</span>. It is suffused
with a lovely and winning beauty of diction, imagery, and
verbal music; and it contains one lyric ‘cry of a soul’ which
for pathos is unsurpassed in Canadian literature, namely,
the Litany of Dorette, the hapless girl-wife, to the Blessed
Virgin Mother beginning,</p>

<p class='noindent'>Considered critically, then, the poetic dramas of Robert
Norwood and the lyric drama of Marjorie Pickthall are,
from the universal point of view, authentic works of art,
originally conceived and beautifully constructed, and, from
the Canadian point of view, are the supreme achievements
in the poetic drama of Canada.</p>

<h3>Humorists</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>THE HUMORISTS OF CANADA: PRE-CONFEDERATION—HALIBURTON—HOWE—
DE MILLE—DUVAR—POST-CONFED­ERATION—LANIGAN—COTES—DRUMMOND—HAM:
NEW SCHOOL—LEACOCK—DONOVAN—DAVIS—MACTAVISH—McARTHUR—HODGINS.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>he</span> name and work of Thomas Chandler Haliburton
as a satirist or humorist so over-shadowed the names
and works of other Canadian humorists that it is a belief,
both in foreign countries and in Canada itself, that the
Canadian people have no genius for humor and that, outside
of Haliburton’s satiric writings, there is no significant
Canadian humorous literature. All this is superstition and
has been perpetuated in two ways. No Canadian literary
historian has remarked the existence of other Canadian
humorists, save Haliburton, though Mark Twain in his
Library of American Humor has included the work of
Haliburton, De Mille, Lanigan; and, secondly, no Canadian
anthologist, save Lawrence J. Burpee, has collected in a
single volume examples of the work of Canadian humorists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pre-Confederation Canadian humor is represented by
the work of Haliburton, Howe, and De Mille. Of these the
work of Haliburton is the significant humor of the period.
In general it is satiric, a criticism of society, aiming to
bring about certain reforms. No other Canadian humorist
since Haliburton, not even Leacock, had or has any gifts
in comic characterization. Howe had no satiric purpose.
His humor, which was chiefly in verse, was written ‘for
the fun of the thing.’
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A native-born Canadian man of letters who has not received
his due is James De Mille, poet, novelist, short story
fictionist and humorist. De Mille, at least in time,
anticipated the new type of American humor which is
associated with the name of Mark Twain. For some
months before Mark Twain’s <span class='it'>The Innocents Abroad</span> was
published (1869), De Mille’s <span class='it'>The Dodge Club</span>, or <span class='it'>Italy in
1859</span> had appeared. This volume is not to be confused
with De Mille’s <span class='it'>Dodge Club Series</span> published in 1871, 1872,
1877 which were humorous and healthful stories for the
young. If, therefore, the humor of Stephen Leacock is
essentially a recrudescence of the American humor which
we see in Franklin and in Mark Twain, and if Leacock
read De Mille and Twain, as presumably he did, then
the first of the Leacockians in Canada, to use an anachronism,
was De Mille, and he is ‘the father’ of the later or
the 20th century Canadian humorists beginning with Leacock.
For the genius of that <span class='it'>genre</span> of humor, as in De
Mille and Twain, is essentially exaggerated nonsense or
nonsense said with a face of seriousness. De Mille’s work
does not lend itself to quotation, but stylistically De Mille’s
humorous prose, aside from the humor itself, is distinctly
engaging or readable by virtue of its simple or popular
diction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away from the traditional humor of the American
or Haliburton style, is the more delicate imaginative humor
of John Hunter-Duvar and the whimsical humor of Grant
Allen. Hunter-Duvar wrote considerable humor in light
ephemeral form and his stories and verse are colored with
many passages of <span class='it'>genre</span> humor and satire. The chief
basis of his reputation as a humorist of a distinct and anomalous
type is found in his extraordinarily conceived narrative
poem, <span class='it'>The Emigration of the Fairies</span>. It deserves
wide reading as an example of the pure humor of fancy.
Grant Allen was a novelist and scientist. He published
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
a volume of light verse, <span class='it'>The Lower Slopes</span>, in which he
indulged his humorous gifts in a series of satiric and
entertaining verses on scientific themes. It is all essentially
the humor of persiflage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Haliburton the extraordinary name in Post-Confederation
Canadian humor is George Thomas Lanigan.
He was born in the Province of Quebec and has the distinction
of having founded what is now the <span class='it'>Daily Star</span>, of
Montreal. He was a brilliant journalist and possessed unusual
versatility of invention and style in prose and verse.
He had all the mental gifts, and some of the faults, native
to the Keltic temperament. His ebullient spirits expressed
themselves in restless activity and with as ready brilliancy
in verse as in prose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His prose humor, which was published serially in <span class='it'>The
World</span>, New York, in the first decade after Confederation,
was fresh and novel and arresting. The series was published
in book form under the title <span class='it'>Fables Out of the World</span>
(1878) and were to their time what the <span class='it'>Fables in Slang</span>
by George Ade are to our time. So compellingly did Lanigan’s
<span class='it'>Fables</span> strike the imagination of Mark Twain that
he republished seven of them in his Library of Humor.
For the most part, Lanigan’s <span class='it'>Fables</span> are satires on the
half-truths which constitute popular moral maxims. They
are all mere absurdities, and mere nonsense; but they contain
a larger truth than the maxims they satirize. They
are sure to awake a chuckle. We quote two examples:—</p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>The Merchant of Venice</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Venetian Merchant who was looking in the lap of luxury
was accosted upon the Rialto by a friend who had not seen him
for many months. ‘How is this?’ cried the latter. ‘When I
last saw you your gaberdine was out at elbows, and now you
sail in your own gondola.’ ‘True,’ replied the Merchant, ‘but
since then I have met with serious losses, and been obliged to
compound with my creditors for ten cents on the dollar.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moral.—Composition is the life of trade.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote-right90percent'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='sc'>The Honest Newsboy</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A Newsboy was passing along the street, when he chanced
to discover a purse of greenbacks. He was at first inclined to
conceal it, but repelling the unworthy suggestion, he asked a
Venerable Man if it was his’n. The Venerable Man looked at
it hurriedly, said it was, patted him on the head, gave him a
quarter, and said he would yet be president. The Venerable
Man then hastened away, but was arrested for having counterfeit
bills in his possession, while the honest Newsboy played
penny-ante with his humble quarter and ran it up to $2.62.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moral.—Honesty is sometimes the best policy.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Though Lanigan’s <span class='it'>Fables</span> in prose were at that time a
new and brilliant type of humor, it is in his humorous ballads
that he surpasses himself, and because of them he remains
unique among Canadian humorists. Some of his
humorous ballads have also been included in anthologies of
<span class='it'>American</span> (!) humor, as, for instance, in Roscoe Johnson’s
volume, <span class='it'>Playday Poetry</span>. The most famous of Lanigan’s
humorous ballads is his egregious piece of persiflage, <span class='it'>The
Ahkoond of Swat</span>. Really, however, much more humorous
are Lanigan’s <span class='it'>The Amateur Orlando</span> and <span class='it'>The Plumber’s
Revenge</span>. Their length prevents quotation here. On account
of its notoriety and the absolute egregiousness of its
comic irresponsibility we select for quotation Lanigan’s
<span class='it'>The Ahkoond of Swat</span>. To give it color and setting we
note briefly the origin of the verses. According to Mr.
Burpee the facts are that ‘one evening, after learning the
fact from the English mail just received, Lanigan announced
that the Akhoond of Swat was dead and that he
was writing a poem about him.’ The verses appeared in
the next morning paper. Following is the text of the
<span class='it'>Ahkoond of Swat</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>In passing we may note another Canadian humorous
poem of the same type which has become famous, namely,
<span class='it'>Hoch de Kaiser</span>, which was composed at a sitting by an
<span class='it'>émigré</span> Canadian journalist who went sometimes by the
name of Rose and sometimes by the name of Gordon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have elsewhere noted the fresh quality of the humor
of Mrs. Everard Cotes (Sarah Jeanette Duncan) and a
whole chapter has been devoted to the poetry of William
Henry Drummond as the creator of a new species of
Canadian humor. The great warm Irish heart of Drummond
was not fitted to create satire or mere fun. His
humor is based upon a tender sentiment or what is known
as ‘the homely pathetic’ and on a special sense of the
humor in <span class='it'>genre</span> characters, particularly the old and the
adolescent <span class='it'>habitant</span> of Quebec.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man quite by himself as a humorist is George Henry
Ham, who has not unfittingly been called ‘the laughing
philosopher’ of Canada. Ham’s humor is essentially the
humor of the ‘after-dinner’ or ‘the occasional’ speaker, and
is for the most part anecdotal. During a long life he
had acquired an inexhaustible fund of the most humorous
anecdotes about Canadian characters or celebrated men.
These were collected and published in his <span class='it'>Reminiscences
of a Raconteur</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Essentially Ham’s humor is not creative; it is the reproductive
humor of the raconteur; but Ham has added to
it by a color and settings of his own. It is the humor
itself and not the style that counts. But while it is humor
and for the most part sheer fun or entertainment, it comes
from a man who has seen many vicissitudes in Canadian
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>
life and history and institutions and who, in his great age,
as human life goes, invites us in his <span class='it'>Reminiscences of a
Raconteur</span> to look upon life and its vicissitudes of good
and ill fortune with courage, serenity, faith and hope—and
not to fear death. Ham’s humor is distinguished as
pleasant medicine for the soul in the hurly-burly of life
and in the contemplation of having some time to depart
from a world that is full of dear companions and pleasant
places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next Canadian systematic humorist, though not
Canadian-born, is Stephen Leacock. Haliburton was a
creator; he really invented, his method of satiric humor,
or if he did not invent the method, he at least originally
created his comic characters. Leacock, who is ‘a graft
on the Canadian literary tree,’ models his humor considerably
after the American manner. It is satiric burlesque
deliberately constructing around serious character or
events extravagant nonsense which is a sort of criticism
of manners and morals of society, but which tends to engage
us more as burlesque than as criticism. Mr. Leacock’s
first book was entitled <span class='it'>Literary Lapses</span>, published
at Montreal in 1910. It was, as the author’s Preface states,
for the most part a collection of sketches which had before
that date appeared in print in various magazines. Two
of the sketches gained the distinction of being reprinted in
<span class='it'>Punch</span> and <span class='it'>The Lancet</span>, London. These were respectively
Leacock’s <span class='it'>Boarding House Geometry</span> and <span class='it'>The New Pathology</span>,
the latter of which had the further distinction of
being reprinted in translations in various German periodicals.
His <span class='it'>Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town</span> approaches
more closely to the unity of a regular novel than any
of his other books and is the highest example of his art.
His style here is personal and familiar almost to undue
flippancy; it is witty and sparkling even to brilliancy; it is
less literary than the material of the <span class='it'>Mariposa Newspacket</span>;
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
it is surrounded with an exuberant atmosphere of
burlesque. Yet in <span class='it'>Sunshine Sketches</span> he has achieved an
unmistakably true characterization of the average ‘little
town’ of Canada—its life and its people—a life which
shows the universal touch that makes the whole world
akin, and at the same time has those narrow, provincial
idiosyncrasies that make it distinctively local and impossible
of portrayal except by one who has lived it. There
is here revealed much of the usually uncovered side of
human nature, lit up with a glow of amusement at the
foibles of our fellow-man, but tempered, more than is
usual with Leacock, with a good-natured sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 1910 onwards to 1922, when Leacock’s <span class='it'>My Discovery
of England</span> was published, the humorist produced
a dozen volumes of his special species of humor and attained
a vogue which places him first amongst Canadian
humorists of the 20th century. He works at it brilliantly,
sometimes in the extreme burlesque manner of Mark
Twain and sometimes in the quiet, humble and drier manner
of the characteristic English humor which appears in
<span class='it'>Punch</span> in its department of ‘Charivaria.’ Unlike Haliburton,
Leacock rather makes the reader behold the humorist
himself figuring away bravely and sometimes futilely,
to divert and amuse or entertain. That is to say, unlike
Haliburton’s humor, which had an easy method of attack
and drew attention to itself, Leacock’s humor gives the
reader an impression of its being <span class='it'>strained</span>, an effort on the
humorist’s part deliberately to make people smile or laugh,
whether they will or not. It is ‘smart,’ as the word is
used in Yankee slang, rather than human and profound.
It ‘tickles’ the fancy and sensibility rather than illuminates
the imagination and informs the moral reason. It is
clever; but like all things that are merely clever it is
ephemerally engaging or pleasing, and it is all a case of
the half being greater than the whole. In short, Leacock’s
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>
humor is for a day, whereas Haliburton’s humor
is for all time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter Donovan is a promising later humorist. His
first book was <span class='it'>Imperfectly Proper</span>. After a short residence
in England since the war, he published <span class='it'>Over ‘Ere
and Back Home</span> (1922). Mr. Donovan is a critic of
society. He is not, however, a critic of constructive social
thought but of conventional thinking and conventional
manners. The arrows of his humor, which are neither
sharp-pointed nor poisonous, are directed against what
Matthew Arnold used to call ‘Philistines’—the ‘nice’ people
who outwardly conform to all the conventionalities
of the law of the land and of the church but who inwardly—when
no one is looking—break these laws. Donovan
directs his humor against shams in society—not the great
shams but those shams which have become acquired habits,
or against all that is the ‘fashion’ or the ‘rage’ of the year
or day. What he really achieves, from the point of view
of vision, is to make us see ourselves as others see us, and
to cause us to ‘chuckle’ over his polite—for he is never
rude or coarse—revealments. Norris Hodgins works
much within the same range as Donovan—<span class='it'>Why Don’t You
Get Married?</span> (1923)—and is not often quite so hilariously
funny, but he comes closer to the daily experiences of
every man and every woman, and there is just a bit more
solidity to his underlying structure of everyday philosophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another vein is the humor of Peter McArthur, who
has been sometimes called ‘The Sage of Ekfrid.’ McArthur
writes as one who, living a pastoral and serious
life, actually looks around upon his neighbors in other
spheres of life and on their striving after wealth and
material goods, and who freshly reflects the thought, as
old as the ancient hills, that a serious and contented mind,
satisfied with the gifts of nature and of God, with pure
friendships and sufficient sustenance for body, possesses
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>
the only permanent satisfactions of life. He presents this
view, not with any originality in thought, but with a manner
or style that is pleasant reading and causes us to fall
in love with life and laughter and simple joys and to look
with charity upon our fellows, and to promote peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new type of Canadian humor, with a new quality of
style, is the humor of Newton MacTavish, Editor of <span class='it'>The
Canadian Magazine</span>, in which periodical Mr. MacTavish
first gave to the public his fresh and piquant humor, under
the title <span class='it'>Thrown In</span>. The sketches were collected in
a volume and published with the same title in 1923. The
aim of MacTavish’s humor is definitively social—to disclose
the hidden humanity of commonplace souls and their essential
unity with their more magnificent fellows. When
his humor is amusing or entertaining, it achieves this quality
not so much by depicting grotesque or ludicrous situations
as by revealing the natural attitudes of pioneer people
towards the common things of life, and the elementally
human idiosyncrasies of the so-called common people.
When it is wit rather than mere humor, MacTavish turns
the light of truth upon human psychology and character,
by way of situation and character-drawing, in terms of
commonplace humanity expressed and colored by homely
speech and anecdote. So that the effect of his humor is
two-fold. For while the reader is being entertained his
mind is also receiving new insight into our common heritage,
our genuine humanity, whatever be our culture or
social status. In short, MacTavish’s humor is philosophical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Roy Davis’ long satiric poem, <span class='it'>Flying Rumors</span>, published
in booklet form at Boston, 1922, we discover a recrudescence
of the satiric spirit of Haliburton. Davis was
born in Nova Scotia, and was educated at Dalhousie University,
Nova Scotia, and Harvard University. He is
Professor of English in the School of Business Administration,
Boston University, of which he is also Assistant Dean.
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>With the same intent as Haliburton, namely, to correct
certain centrifugal tendencies in society, Davis employs
satire, not, as did Haliburton, in prose, but in verse, which
was the traditional medium of the satire of Haliburton’s
and Davis’ Loyalist ancestors in Pre-Revolutionary days
in the Old Colonies. The form of Davis’ ‘essay on man
and society’ in verse adds, on the side of novelty, a fresh
contribution to the satiric literature of Canada. The
poet has avoided going back to the traditional rhymed
couplet of the Loyalist satirists in Nova Scotia, but has
used an octavo stanzaic form in which the first six lines
are rhymed alternately, and the last two are rhymed as a
couplet. This effects a pleasant sense of finality and rest.
Besides, Davis has invented a considerable number of lines
which are musical, and arresting or startling in novelty of
imagery, as, for instance, this ingenious and daring couplet:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A goose-step strutting Kaiser, kissing Mars,</p>
<p class='line0'>Has missed the humor of the midnight stars!</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>When, therefore, we survey the history of Canadian
humor from Haliburton to Leacock, and from Leacock to
MacTavish and Davis, the humorists who have remained
salient and popular, and whose work seems to have the
inherent qualities which make for permanent appeal, are
Haliburton and Lanigan. And when we survey and note
the variety and distinction of Canadian humor—that it is,
in many ways, a humor quite by itself, and that it is of
considerable quantity—we may reply to certain literary
historians and critics that Canadians are not, as they are
superstitiously believed to be, a humorless people and
quite without a literature of humor. For Canada has produced
several notable humorists, an admirable literature
of humor; and the work of one of Canada’s humorists,
Haliburton, has long possessed international renown—a
place in permanent world literature.</p>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>THE RISE OF NATIVE AND NATIONAL REALISTIC STAGE DRAMA
IN CANADA: THE LITTLE THEATRE AND THE WORK OF
CARROLL AIKINS AND MERRILL DENISON.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span><span class='sc'>lthough</span> Canada is relatively rich in Poetic Drama,
there is no evidence of a developed Stage Drama. Part
of the literary future of the country lies in the development
of native and national stage drama. A significant beginning
in native production of the acted drama was inaugurated
by Mr. Carroll Aikins who established in the Okanagan
Valley, at a centre named Naramata, a ‘Little Theatre,’
which he named The Home Theatre. It was formally
opened in November 1920 by the Rt. Hon. Mr. Meighen,
then Prime Minister. Mr. Aikins’ aims were to produce
a national drama, staged according to artistic conceptions
of simplicity and beauty, and to teach the people to appreciate
good plays produced with simple and beautiful
properties, stage sets, and lighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to realize these ideals it was necessary to choose
good plays that had already been standardized and to train
his actors directly in the Home Theatre. Mr. Aikins’ belief
was that by developing in the people a love of good
plays produced in a Canadian theatre under Canadian
direction, the people sooner or later would demand the production
of Canadian plays and that this demand would lead
to the creation of plays on Canadian subjects by Canadian
playwrights. That is to say, Mr. Aikins believed that the
movement he started in the Home Theatre would at length
result in the creating of Canadian Native and National
Stage Drama.
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1921 Mr. Aikins produced on the stage of the Home
Theatre an acted version of <span class='it'>The Trojan Women</span> by the
ancient Greek dramatist Euripides. In 1922 he produced
his own Passion Play, <span class='it'>Victory in Defeat</span>, a beautifully
staged pantomime of moving pictures against a sky of
changing light, interpreted with the aid of a reader and
expressive music—the first experiment of its kind attempted
in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ‘Little Theatre’ movement has also achieved something
for the appreciation of good Canadian plays in the
cities of Winnipeg, Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, and Vancouver.
At Hart House in Toronto, there has been considerable
activity concerned with the production of Canadian
plays. In April, 1921, Merrill Denison’s <span class='it'>Brothers in
Arms</span> was produced at that theatre; and in April 1922
another of his plays, <span class='it'>From Their Own Place</span>, was produced.
These, with two others, were published in book form in
1923 under the title <span class='it'>The Unheroic North</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denison’s plays are Canadian by virtue of the author’s
parentage and family traditions (his mother being the late
Flora McD. Denison), and by the plays themselves being
on Canadian themes, with Canadian characters moving in
Canadian surroundings. They are realistic satiric dramas
of life and thought in Canadian ‘backwoods’ and rural settlements.
The dramatist presents the life and speech and
conduct of these characters with such broad realism that
the plays themselves are a mordant satire on existence and
society in isolated Canadian communities. But Denison’s
plays are also a satire <span class='it'>within</span> a satire. It is not life in certain
Canadian communities that he is really satirizing, but
an attitude of the Canadian people themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The people of Canada dearly love ‘high’ romance and
spurious sentimentality. They find this spurious sentimentality
in some Canadian fiction, and the romance in the
poetic dramas of Mair, Mrs. Curzon, Wilfred Campbell,
Dr. Dollard, Robert Norwood, and others. Boldly, therefore,
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
and with evident sincerity, Merrill Denison conceived
the idea of satirizing the lovers of spurious sentimentality
by presenting them with plays which would be the antithesis
of ‘high’ romance and affected sentimentality—with
life so broadly or coarsely realistic that the people of Canada
would <span class='it'>not</span> like the life or the plays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two of the plays—<span class='it'>Brothers in Arms</span> and the <span class='it'>Weather
Breeder</span>—portray life in the Canadian backwoods districts
as Mr. Denison has observed that life. Two of the plays—<span class='it'>From
Their Own Place</span> and <span class='it'>Marsh Hay</span>—portray, according
to Mr. Denison, life in the poorer or more sordid farming
districts of Canada. The dramatist has explained his
motive and aim. He says: ‘These plays have their origin
in the needs of a theatre—not <span class='it'>the</span> theatre. <span class='it'>Brothers in
Arms</span> was written because a Canadian comedy was needed
to fill a bill and none could be found. In writing it as an
innovation, I wrote of a part of Canada I knew, and introduced
as characters actual Canadians. The result was
new, but, as might have been expected, Canadian. It must
be remembered that these plays were written for a Canadian
theatre, not Broadway, and that any literature of the theatre
in Canada must follow the same course—be written
for Canadian production.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be regretted that Denison went to sordid and
vulgar society in Canada for his dramatic subjects or
material. But he had just cause to satire Canadian life by
means of realistic Canadian plays. For the intellectual dishonesty,
and the ‘immoral moral psychology,’ which creates
the spurious or hectic sentimentality in certain Canadian
fiction would compel a sane-minded man to show the other
side of the picture, and to show it with pervasive and vivid
realism. Denison perceived and felt the profound untruth
or falsity of certain forms of 20th century Canadian fiction.
In his view, it was all too ‘nice’ and saccharine as art; it
had neither truth nor strength. Denison felt that no such
men and women as appear in many of the novels of the
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>
Realistic Romances exist in Canada. In his opinion, the
substance of these novels is puerile and vain invention.
He, therefore, decided to present to the Canadian public
real men and women as they really live, move and have
their being in Canada—even if they are, as indeed they
are, sordid and vulgarized men and women. Denison’s
plays, then, are a Protest; they are also a Satire. What
the dramatist is protesting against is not the life that he
presents in his plays. What he is satirizing is not Canadian
life as such. He is protesting against intellectual dishonesty
and spurious sentimentality in Canadian fiction. He
is satirizing the life and characters which these Canadian
fictionists have presented in their romances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denison presents his material in three one-act plays
with four to six characters, and in one four-act play with
fourteen characters. It is the business of the dramatic critic
to estimate Denison’s success in dramaturgy, to determine
whether they are well-constructed and actable plays. On
the strictly literary side, his plays in <span class='it'>The Unheroic North</span>,
despite their sordid or vulgarized characters, and despite
the sections of society and life presented in them, intrigue
the attention and make interesting and diverting reading.
As satires on the methods and ideals of certain Canadian
romantic fictionists, on the social life at least of certain
Canadian communities Denison’s realistic dramas are a significant
beginning of creative Stage Drama in Canada.</p>

VALANCY CRAWFORD—JOHN MCCRAE—CANADIAN POEMS

</div>

<h4>I. THE POETRY OF THE CIVIL REBELLION<br/> AND THE SOUTH AFRICAN WAR</h4>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>t</span> is a literary phenomenon by itself that the best or
most popular of the inspirational and the commemorative
war verse by permanently resident <span class='it'>émigrés</span> or native-born
Canadians was the work of the country’s women
poets. No samples of martial verse inspired by the War
of 1812-14 seem to be extant. The records of martial
verse produced in Canada begin with the Civil War of
1837-38 and the inspirational war lyrics of Mrs. Susanna
Moodie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifteen years after the war opened, Mrs. Moodie’s
martial lyrics were published in her <span class='it'>Roughing It In The
Bush</span> (1852, two vols.). In ‘The Advertisement’ (which
is a sort of publisher’s Preface) to this work, the publisher
recounts the origin and effect of Mrs. Moodie’s inspirational
war verse. ‘During the rebellion,’ he says, ‘her loyal
lyrics, prompted by strong affection for her native country
[England], were circulated and sung throughout the colony
[Ontario], and produced a great effect in rousing an enthusiastic
feeling in favor of public order.’ But Mrs.
Moodie herself modestly remarks (<span class='it'>op. cit. sup.</span>, Vol. 2):—</p>

<div class='blockquote100percent'>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>I must own that my British spirit was fairly aroused, and as I
could not aid in subduing the enemies of my beloved country with
my arm, I did what little I could to serve the good cause with my pen.
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>
It may probably amuse my readers, to give them a few specimens of
these loyal staves, which were widely circulated through the colony
at the time.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It will suffice to quote the first and last stanzas of her
<span class='it'>Address to the Freemen of Canada</span> (<span class='it'>op. cit. sup.</span>, p. 191)
in order to show that Mrs. Moodie wrote no mediocre
martial verse of the inspirational type:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Canadians, will you see the flag</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Beneath whose folds your fathers bled,</p>
<p class='line0'>Supplanted by the vilest rag</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That ever host to rapine led?</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou emblem of a tyrant’s sway,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Thy triple hues are dyed in gore;</p>
<p class='line0'>Like his, thy power has passed away,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Like his, thy short-lived triumph’s o’er.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>In a footnote Mrs. Moodie explains that ‘the vilest
rag’ is the tri-colored flag assumed by the rebels. The
use of the phrase has, of course, both psychological and
aesthetic warrant. The thought of the tri-colored flag,
of its earlier bloody history in the French Revolution, revolted
her sense of nobility and righteousness, and, like
Homer’s, her diction and imagery sank in correspondence
with the fall in the spiritual dignity of her subject. Aesthetically
viewed, she was quite justified in sinking and
rising with the emotional dignity of her subject. She sinks
in the third stanza, but rises magniloquently in the fifth
(final) stanza. Thus:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>By all the blood for Britain shed</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;On many a glorious battlefield,</p>
<p class='line0'>To the free winds her standard spread,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Nor to these base insurgents yield.</p>
<p class='line0'>With loyal bosoms beating high,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In your good cause securely trust;</p>
<p class='line0'>‘God and Victoria’ be your cry,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And crush the traitors to the dust.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Compared with standard martial songs, such as Burns’
<span class='it'>Scots Wha’ Hae wi’ Wallace Bled</span>, or <span class='it'>The March of the
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
Men of Harlech</span>, the first three lines of the foregoing
stanza are really excellent. The vocables are mouth filling,
the rhythm moves rapidly and carries one with it, and
though the third line might be improved by the use of the
word ‘fling’ for the word ‘spread’ in the text, still ‘To the
free winds her standard spread’ increases respiration, and
stimulates ideated sensations of free movement and expanding
personality. Altogether, it is a vigorous—a
‘breezy’ line. No Canadian need feel ashamed of it. And
what magnificent energy is in the last two lines of the
stanza! The reader no sooner reaches ‘God and Victoria’
than he shifts back the accent to the word ‘God,’ emphasizes
it with a full burst of breath and with a change in
pitch, and then impulsively spurts out the utterance of the
remaining syllables in the same changed pitch until he attacks
the word ‘cry,’ which is both oxytoned and emphasized.
Thus the line becomes a veritable battle-shout
and inspiriting slogan. After this ringing, rousing, energizing
oxytone line comes the barytone cadence, ‘And crush
the traitors to the dust.’ The reader braces himself for
action—takes in a full breath, fronts his eyes, sets his
jaws, and all his muscles, and lunges forward to the fray.
Both are brave lines; both are energizing, impelling; and
the whole stanza is a magnificent sample of inspiriting martial
verse. No Canadian need feel ashamed to recite it
before the admirers of Robert Burns or William Duthie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Moodie’s modest estimate of her martial lyrics
is not just to the poet. They are better than mere ‘loyal
staves,’ fitted solely to ‘amuse’ casual readers. That they
were widely circulated and sung throughout Canada at
the time when they were needed, is proof that they possessed
lyrical eloquence and the inspirational power to stir the
heart and impel the will to honorable action. They are
good singing verse, but they are not genuine poetry. All
that is required in an inspirational war lyric is that it come
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
warm from the heart and hand; that it be human, manly,
direct in thought; that it be ringing in lilt and swinging in
rhythm; and that it be respectable technically as verse. To
write martial verse that fulfils all these requirements and
to write it immediately on demand is no easy task. Judged
by these standards Mrs. Moodie excelled in inspirational
war lyricism. It is true that Harriet A. Wilkins, Mrs.
Curzon, Mrs. Annie Rothwell-Christie, Valancy Crawford,
and Agnes Machar surpassed her in poetic war lyricism.
But this was due to the fact that their best martial verse
was commemorative, and was written <span class='it'>after</span> the deeds or
events celebrated by them, and at a time when they could
compose in peace and at leisure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of these later Canadian women poets of martial verse
the supreme artist was Mrs. Annie Rothwell-Christie. The
verse of the others, even Isabella Valancy Crawford’s novel
<span class='it'>The Rose of a Nation’s Thanks</span>, and Agnes Maule
Machar’s swinging <span class='it'>Our Lads to the Front</span>, though choicer
in diction and imagery than Mrs. Moodie’s, hardly rise
above the quality of good verse. Mrs. Annie Rothwell-Christie’s
commemorative martial verse on the other hand,
attains to the dignity and beauty of pure poetry. We do
not need the statement of the English poet Sir Edwin Arnold,
that ‘the best war songs of the Half-breed Rebellion
were written by Annie Rothwell-Christie.’ Dignity,
beauty, melody and compelling pathos are in every line she
wrote. These qualities can be observed in the lines we
quote from her <span class='it'>After the Battle</span> and <span class='it'>Welcome Home</span>, selecting,
first, two stanzas from <span class='it'>After the Battle</span>:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extraordinary imagery of the last line of the first
stanza (couplet)—‘the shout of the savage their requiem,
the hiss of the rifle their knell’ and the novel beauty of the
similitude in the first line of the second stanza are enough
to raise these verses to the dignity of pure poetry. Besides,
there is a spiritual militancy in the rhythm that soothes or
solaces, while its cadences solemnize the soul, begetting
resignation to the Will of the Universe. Or listen to the
triumphant, sonorous verbal music of these lines from
<span class='it'>Welcome Home</span>:—</p>

<p class='line0'>War-worn, sun-scorched, strained with the dust of toil,</p>

<p class='line0'>With cheers, and fling our banners to the winds;</p>

<p class='pindent'>We hear drum beats, bugle calls, and the tramp of
armed men on the march in those first two spondaic
phrases—‘war-worn, sun-scorched.’ A new emotional experience
comes to us with the quicker moving syllables in
the next two lines; the rhythm is fitted to exultation. Also
we are treated to a new but brilliant alliterative metaphor—‘cleave
the sky with cheers.’ We are in the realm of
poetry. But fine as are the preceding examples of Mrs.
Annie Rothwell-Christie’s commemorative martial verse,
the pathos of the following, from <span class='it'>The Woman’s Part</span>, is
overwhelmingly human and moving and ennobling. The
inspiration is derived from reflecting whether to those who,
fired by love of adventure or country, have gone to war,
and fallen, the mothers, sisters, and sweethearts shall give
regrets, prayers, or tears. The poet disparages all these,
and turns to solace the mother or wife, whose son or husband
had died on the battlefield:—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>O, woman-heart be strong,</p>
<p class='line0'>Too full for words—too humble for a prayer—</p>
<p class='line0'>Too faithful to be fearful—offer here</p>
<p class='line0'>Your sacrifice of patience. Not for long</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span></p>
<p class='line0'>The darkness. When the dawn of peace breaks bright,</p>
<p class='line0'>Blessed she who welcomes whom her God shall save,</p>
<p class='line0'>But honored in her God’s and country’s sight</p>
<p class='line0'>She who lifts empty arms to cry, ‘<span class='it'>I Gave</span>!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>After reading that noble poem of love and pathos, and
being moved to emotion too deep for tears, one knows that
all distinctions for sex are man-made and ephemeral and
abortive—that only ‘soul,’ whatever be its form of earthly
tenement, is real. For Annie Rothwell-Christie who wrote
that poem was altogether soul—superman, superwoman—gifted
with the speech of angels. Her martial verse is
absolutely unique, and a distinct contribution to perduring
war poetry.</p>

<h4>II. THE POETRY OF THE WORLD WAR</h4>

<p class='pindent'>The Canadian Poetry of the World War is, as was
previous martial verse by Canadian poets, both inspirational
and commemorative. What is significant for literary
history, is, first, that there is a distinct advance in the excellence
both of the ideas and of the artistic form of the
Canadian poetry of the world war; and, secondly, that both
the activity in poetic composition occasioned by the late
war and the quality of the poetry became an inspiration to
other poets whose genius was dormant and unawakened,
and caused a genuine Renascence of the Poetic Spirit and
of Poetry in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In what respect may the Canadian Poetry of the world
war be said to be excellent, or even unexcelled by the martial
poetry of the United States, if excelled by that of England
and France? It is relatively great in noble ideas. In
it we see clearly and vividly what Canadian men and
women, at home and in the field of war, really thought
and felt about war and death, love and home and country,
self-sacrifice, and the good green earth, and peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Truth, beauty and splendor of ideas</span>—these are the three
supreme excellences of the Canadian poetry written by the
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
soldier-poets in active service on the fighting field, and by
the professional or amateur non-combatant poets at home,
during the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the artistic form of this poetry, considering all
the conditions of distraction and perturbance under which
it was written, the wonder is that it has any formal finish
at all. As a matter of fact, however, the Canadian poetry
inspired by the world war cannot be depreciated as ‘twinkling
trivialities’ either in substance or in form. All the
best of it is good poetry—originally conceived, winningly
suffused with beauty of sentiment, rich in noble ideas and
spiritual imagery, engaging in verbal music, and technically
well-wrought. If the formal finish of Canadian Poetry
of the world war is not always quite the equal of the
British and American poetry similarly occasioned, still the
altogether most famous and most popular poem of the war
and most likely to perdure in the popular memory, is neither
the sonnet of the English soldier-poet, Rupert Brooke, <span class='it'>The
Soldier</span>, nor the poem of the American soldier-poet,
Alan Seeger, <span class='it'>I Have a Rendezvous with Death</span>, but the
lyric of the Canadian soldier-poet, John McCrae, <span class='it'>In Flanders
Fields</span>. Further, special circumstances, special sentiments,
and special color and form went to making the
poem by McCrae the supreme lyric of the world war, and
the popularity of <span class='it'>In Flanders Fields</span> affected the appreciation
of other Canadian poetry of the late war to such a
degree as to cause the popular imagination, as well as the
critical sense of the cultured, to estimate all other Canadian
poetry of the world war as so far below McCrae’s exquisite
lyric as to be second-rate in substance and form. This is
not so. Save that they do not embody a special form and
are not as musically insinuating as McCrae’s, the best of
other Canadian poems of the world war are as nobly conceived,
as spiritually subduing or exalting, and as technically
finished as <span class='it'>In Flanders Fields</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>During the world war, as in previous wars, the women
poets of Canada were to the fore in writing inspirational
and commemorative martial verse. In Garvin’s <span class='it'>Canadian
Poems of the Great War</span> about one third (26) of the total
number (73) of poets represented are women, and their
war verse, especially the verse of Katherine Hale (whose
poetry has been already dealt with), Helena Coleman,
Frances Harrison, Isabel Graham, Agnes Maule Machar,
Gertrude Bartlett, Grace Blackburn, Jean Blewett, Minnie
Hallowell Bowen, Louise Morey Bowman, Isabelle Ecclestone
Mackay, Lilian Leveridge, Lucy Montgomery, Beatrice
Redpath, Sheila Rand, Florence Randal Livesay,
Richard Scrace (Mrs. J. B. Williamson), Virna Sheard,
Eloise Street, Ruth Strong, is not a whit below the level
of the war verse by Canadian men and in some instances
surpasses the latter’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. O’Hagan’s <span class='it'>Songs of Heroic Days</span> (1916) is a popular
volume, in which, for the most part, the poet recrudesces,
in good newspaper verse, the traditional war spirit of
bloodshed, retaliation and revenge. The poems, however,
are made engaging by a ready humor and an Irish <span class='it'>jeu
d’esprit</span> in the thought of ‘squaring things’ with an enemy
guilty of ‘dhirty thricks’ in war. Several other volumes of
war verse appeared during and shortly after the close of
the war—<span class='it'>The Fighting Men of Canada</span> by Douglas Durkin;
<span class='it'>Over the Hills of Home and Other Poems</span> by Lilian
Leveridge; <span class='it'>Sea Dogs and Men at Arms</span> by Jesse Edgar
Middleton; <span class='it'>A Canadian Twilight and Other Poems</span> (posthumous)
by Lieutenant Bernard Freeman Trotter;
<span class='it'>Laurentian Lyrics and Other Poems</span> (1915) by Lieutenant
Arthur S. Bourinot; <span class='it'>Insulters of Death</span> and <span class='it'>The New
Apocalyse</span> by Sergeant J. D. Logan, and several other
volumes by returned men. The only comprehensive anthology
of verse of the Great War, written by Canadians,
is J. W. Garvin’s <span class='it'>Canadian Poems of the Great War</span>
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
(1918). This volume furnishes adequate proof that, as
foreign critics have said, ‘the war poetry written by Canadian
civilians and Canadian poets on active service is as
excellent as that written by the poets of the older Allied
Nations.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the purpose of just appreciation we remark the
fine, spirited, and imaginatively impressive qualities, as
well as the artistic finish, of selected Canadian war poems
that are really worthy to stand beside the best verse of
English and American poets who were inspired by the late
war. Aside from McCrae’s <span class='it'>In Flanders Fields</span> the most
celebrated commemorative war poem by a Canadian is Dr.
J. B. Dollard’s sonnet to the memory of Rupert Brooke—a
sonnet in which, as English and American critics observed,
Dr. Dollard made beautiful use of the supposed
cause of Brooke’s death (sunstroke, ‘arrows of Apollo’)
and the place of burial in the Aegean. Brooke’s grave is
on the island of Scyros, not Lemnos. But the error in
fact only enhances the beauty of the poem:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most lilting example of Canadian inspirational war
verse is Douglas Durkin’s <span class='it'>The Fighting Men of Canada</span>.
It is spirited and inspiriting. The colloquial diction of
the refrains charges it with veracity, vividness, and with
‘the punch’ which the London critic, Mr. E. B. Osborn,
desiderates in the content of what are, in his view, the only
‘true war poems,’ namely, ‘song-pictures of the campaigns

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Durkin’s ballad is a human, veracious war-poem in
the traditional spirit of Campbell’s <span class='it'>Battle of the Baltic</span>, Tennyson’s
<span class='it'>Ballad of the Revenge</span>, Newbolt’s <span class='it'>Drake’s Drum</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>
It is designedly inspirational after the manner, and with
the substance, of the old heroic ‘fighting spirit.’ It is,
therefore, a recrudescence of a war spirit and an ideal of
poetic inspiration, aim, and content which were not the real
and authentic spirit, motive, and ideal of the best Canadian,
British, French, or American poetry of the world war. In
short, Mr. Durkin’s poem, <span class='it'>The Fighting Men of Canada</span>,
lilting, spirited, and inspiriting as it is, must critically be
estimated as an obsolete form of ‘recruiting’ ballad rather
than as a true inspirational poem conceived and written according
to the characteristic genius of the poetry of the
world war. As a reversion to the old type of martial
poem, it deserves mention. Possibly it may be instanced
as the nearest approach to a Canadian war-song, though
the extraordinary fact is that not a single war-song, of the
popular or of the marching species, was written by a Canadian
civilian or soldier-poet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the war verse of another poet we find the kind of
poetry that fired the imagination and moved the will of the
men of Canada who went to the world war. To Lloyd
Roberts, son of Charles G. D. Roberts, the war poetry of
the British Empire, as well as Canada, is indebted for two
of the most striking and impressive short poems in the new
spirit of inspirational verse inspired by the world war. His
<span class='it'>Come Quietly, England</span>, simple and direct in thought, free
in form, colloquial in diction, but positive, candid, sincere,
is one of the most arresting and convincing poems that have
for a theme ‘the call to arms’—not for King, or Country,
nor for fear or anything else undivine:—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The Literary Digest</span> remarked Lloyd Roberts’ <span class='it'>Come

of what may be called the philosophy of the war from the
English [British] point of view because it puts so candidly
into words the thoughts that are in the minds of the
author’s fellow-countrymen.’ The other poem by Roberts,
also in his new simple, colloquial, direct style, is entitled
<span class='it'>If I Must</span>. It is the most remarkably original ‘anti-pacifist’
poem written by an English-speaking poet. It takes the
form of a quasi-dramatic monologue, and concludes with a
stanza which has, in journalistic slang, ‘punch’ in it. We
quote the whole poem:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that poem we perceive, unmistakably, how even war
verse may rise to the spiritual dignity of absolute poetry,
and by its ideal substance and spiritual grandeur achieve
the highest moral and religious function—the function,
namely, of dignifying or glorifying the human spirit with
Christlikeness in self-slaying love for the perfection and
happiness of humanity. Only a too fastidious and perverted
criticism will deny to the best of the Canadian poetry
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>
of the World War a distinction in truth, beauty, and splendor
of ideas and in technical artistry that gives it the right
to an equal place beside the significant war verse of the
British and United States poets. Certainly in technique
it is quite as finished as the American war poetry, and in
ideas of ‘uncompelled and undiluted chivalry,’ it is as noble
and eloquent as the war poetry of the British singers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE HYMN WRITERS OF CANADA—ALLINE­—CLEVELAND—SCRIVEN—
MURRAY—SCOTT­—RAND—DEWART—WALKER—AND
OTHERS.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span> <span class='sc'>hymn</span> is a form of sacred lyrical literature. It
must be popular literature, but not necessarily pure
poetry or permanent literature. A hymn is properly defined
not by what it <span class='it'>is</span> in literary qualities but by what it
<span class='it'>does</span> for the human spirit—for the heart and the religious
imagination. It aims lyrically to express dependence on
divine providence, to praise the divine perfections, to give
thanks for divine mercies and benefits, and to supplicate
divine aid in doubt and weakness and divine consolation
in tribulation and defeat. A hymn, in short, is the spontaneous
lyrical expression of a paternal and filial relationship
between Man and God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The structural qualities which constitute a true hymn
are few and readily understood. Since a hymn must above
all things be potent over the hearts and imagination of <span class='it'>all</span>
the people, its diction must be vernacular—simple words
of one and two syllables. Since a hymn must be singable
by <span class='it'>all</span> the people in concert, its metrical flow must be short
and rhythmical. In aesthetic qualities a hymn should be
simple but beautiful in thought, sentiment and imagery. In
moral qualities a hymn should be suggestive of human but
holy relations between Man and Divine Providence. These
are the prime qualities that constitute the popularity of a
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
hymn and give it a place either in permanent poetry or in
permanent hymnody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several Canadians, <span class='it'>émigrés</span> or native-born, have written
hymns which have a rightful and permanent place in
church hymnody. The history of Canadian hymnography
dates back to the year 1786. In that year Henry Alline,
leader of the ‘New Lights’ schism in Nova Scotia, published
his <span class='it'>Hymns and Spiritual Songs</span>. He was as prolific a
hymn writer as Charles Wesley, having five books of hymns
to his credit. His diction is not always true to the demands
of a hymn; sometimes it is stilted and too literary. But
his imagery is simple and the movement of his thought
is direct. The chief merit of his hymns is their genuine
lyrical quality; they have rhythmical flow. One or two
of them have held a permanent place in church hymnody,
as, for instance, the hymn beginning with this homely
image expressed in vernacular English:—</p>

<p class='line0'>Amazing sight! the Saviour stands</p>
<p class='line0'>And knocks at every door—</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Of the Cleveland family in the Old Colonies two members
emigrated to Nova Scotia—Aaron Cleveland, who
became minister of Mather’s (now St. Matthew’s) church,
Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Benjamin Cleveland who joined
in with the ‘New Lights,’ and emulated Alline as a hymn
writer. One of his hymns still finds a place in church
hymnody in Canada, the familiar hymn beginning</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Oh, could I find from day to day</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A nearness to my God.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>None of the hymns of Alline or Cleveland, however,
attained a world-wide popularity. The first Canadian to
write a hymn that has become not only world-famous but
also has been translated into several ‘heathen tongues’ as
well as civilized languages was Joseph Scriven, author of
the simple spiritual song, <span class='it'>What a Friend We Have in Jesus</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>
The man and the hymn have a remarkable history, which
is recounted by Rev. James Clelland in his biographical
sketch in a tiny thirty-page booklet entitled: <span class='it'>What a Friend
We Have in Jesus, and Other Hymns by Joseph Scriven</span>.
It was published at Port Hope, Ontario, in 1895.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For many years the hymn had been attributed, without
authentication, to Dr. Horatius Bonar. But in 1893 a letter
appeared in the <span class='it'>New York Observer</span>, in which it was
stated that the hymn had been found amongst some papers
belonging to Joseph Scriven, who had ended his life by
suicide. Scriven was a local preacher but he was a graduate
of Trinity College, Dublin, and was, therefore, a man
of respectable culture. Like Cowper, Scriven suffered from
melancholia; and it is natural to suppose that he had written
the hymn after recovery from one of his fits of melancholia.
He was a shy man, and after writing the hymn
gave a copy of it to his mother, from whom he extracted
a promise that she would not reveal its existence or show
it to anyone else. But whether the mother’s pride in her
son’s accomplishment overcame her, or whether due to
some sort of accident, the hymn reached a certain Mr.
Converse, a musician, and he at once set it to music of
the more popular kind. Soon the hymn attained a popular
vogue in the United States and from there gained equally
popular vogue in Canada. Some are inclined to believe
that it was not the hymn itself but the musical setting
that created its popularity. No doubt the musical setting
to Lyte’s <span class='it'>Abide With Me</span>, or to Newman’s <span class='it'>Lead Kindly
Light</span>, has considerable to do with the appeal of those
hymns. Newman expressly attributes the popularity of
his hymn to the musical setting and not to the spiritual
beauty of the text. But the musical setting to Scriven’s
<span class='it'>What a Friend We Have In Jesus</span> is so poor in melodic
invention and so lacking in cantante quality and rhythmic
flow that as a tune or melody it is not singable or infectious
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>
and could not be a compelling ‘sacred folksong.’ We
must, therefore, charge its popularity to the appeal of the
text of the hymn to some elemental want or need of humble
human hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whatever the cause of the popularity of this hymn,
whether the words or the musical setting or both, the
fact remains that it is the most widely known hymn in
Christian hymnology. It has been translated into many of
the civilized and the barbaric languages of the world, and
more than a hundred million impressions of the hymn
have been printed. Searching for a psychological explanation
of its appeal to the universal human heart, we
know that as a matter of fact it has solaced, as one writer
puts it, ‘millions and millions of souls, from the criminal
on his way to the scaffold to the ocean traveller in his last
moment aboard a sinking ship; from the negro in his
wretched plantation cabin to the highest dignitary of the
evangelical churches; from the unclad heathen denizen of
the cannibalistic South Sea Islands or in wildest Africa
to the most learned savant of the most civilized land.’ The
obvious explanation of its appeal is that Scriven’s hymn
expresses, both for the humble and for the highest, the
elemental and inevitable sense of <span class='it'>dependence</span> for life and
happiness on some spiritual power that is mighty to comfort,
solace, sustain, and save. When that sense of dependence
comes over any human being, and when such a human
being feels that there is an ever-ready invisible hand to
sustain or succor, in that moment the sense of dependence
and of ever-ready aid, and of joy or comfort or hope thus
awakened, are expressed in emotionalized rhythm, which
is religious song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scriven lacked lyrical or rhythmical sensibility, and
his famous hymn possesses no aesthetic or artistic appeal.
But in times of need, aesthetics are the poorest support
and solace. In spite, then, of the lyrical and aesthetic defects
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
of Scriven’s simple hymn, it has remained, by virtue
of its elemental appeal to people of all estates and by its
solacing and sustaining power, one of the world’s perduring
sacred songs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a strictly Canadian point of view and with reference
to aesthetic qualities which give a hymn a dignity of
poetry, the most notable and significant hymn composed by
a native-born Canadian is Robert Murray’s <span class='it'>From Ocean
Unto Ocean</span>. The author was born and educated in Nova
Scotia. From early childhood he disclosed a Keltic gift
of imagination and fondness for expressing his emotions
in verse. Dr. Murray was a religious journalist, and, as
editor of <span class='it'>The Presbyterian Witness</span>, did much to raise
ordinary journalism to the dignity of literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was his custom to write hymns and to publish them
anonymously in the religious press. Those who had an
eye for the revision of church hymnals were struck by the
aesthetic beauty and dignity as well as religious fervor of
Dr. Murray’s hymns. They are indeed extraordinary, and
the substance of them is so universalized that they fit the
hymnals or Books of Praise of any Christian communion,
Protestant or Catholic. His hymns are included in the
<span class='it'>Book of Praise</span> of the Presbyterian Church of Canada; in
the <span class='it'>Book of Common Praise</span> of the Church of England in
Canada; and in <span class='it'>The Hymnary</span> of the Scottish Churches.
Rev. A. W. Mahon observes in his readable brochure,
<span class='it'>Canadian Hymns and Hymn Writers</span> (1908): ‘Thirteen
Canadians contribute to the New Church of England Book
of Common Praise, including Canon Welsh of Toronto and
the late Dean Partridge of Fredericton, but Dr. Murray’s
contributions exceed all other in number and in intrinsic
merit.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>To appreciate Murray’s <span class='it'>From Ocean Unto Ocean</span>—its
intrinsic merits, as well as its special qualities and fervor
which embody and express the Canadian national spirit—the
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>
whole poem must be read and felt both as a hymn for
devotional and for national occasions. Following is the
full text of Dr. Murray’s hymn:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The diction of this hymn is simple, vernacular; of 160
words in the text only ten are of Latin origin, and even
these are as short and familiar as our Anglo-Saxon diction.
The rhythmic flow is thoroughly lyrical. But though simple
in diction and lyrical structure, there is a universality
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>
of reach or sweep in its imagery that, at least relatively
to most other hymns, raises Murray’s hymn to the dignity
of poetry. There is no provincialism in it. There is no
denominationalism in it. There is no narrow or bigoted
ethics in it. It is thoroughly human and humane. It possesses
universality and spiritual dignity. It is all that a
true hymn should be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murray’s hymn, moreover, in humanity and spiritual
dignity, contrasts winningly with the original form of
the British, which is also the Canadian, National Anthem.
This so-called anthem has been revised so as to remove
from it certain inane thoughts and sentiments and imagery
that were not consistent with Christian charity and the ideal
of human brotherhood. Canada has, too, its own indigenous
National Song or Hymn which is the text to a
sonorous organ-toned musical setting by Calixa Lavallée.
The original text of the Canadian National Hymn is
by Routhier. It is patriotic in the old exclusive sense, containing
that kind of patriotism which is solicitous about
the mere material success and aggrandizement of Canada.
But Murray’s <span class='it'>From Ocean Unto Ocean</span> is so human and so
humane, so unracial, so unprovincial, so unsectarian, and
by its imagery so informed with the free and all-embracing
spirit of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, bounding the
vast Canadian prairies and mountains and forests, that its
spiritual sweep takes in the whole of Canada without respect
to race or region or religion, or high degree or low
degree of person, and is fitted to be, if not the National
Anthem, at any rate the National Hymn, of Canada. It
is at once both Christian and Universal—a distinctive and
authentic hymn, and an original contribution to permanent
Canadian hymnody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murray was not a creative poet in the sense of being
a systematic poet. But Canon Frederick George Scott,
who is a member of the Systematic School of Canadian
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>
poets, has written hymns. They are strictly evangelical,
rather than universal in thought and scope, and are in the
traditional hymn form. They have a sweet simplicity and
a spiritual dignity but, beyond their lyrical or rhythmic expressiveness,
have no especial aesthetic and artistic qualities
that call for particular critical consideration. The
same appreciation suits a critical estimate of the hymns by
Silas T. Rand, Edward Hartley Dewart, Charles Innis
Cameron, Louisa Walker and other accepted Hymn Writers
of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rand’s Latin Hymns are interesting as translations and
are literary phenomena by themselves. Cameron was a
poet and his hymns have an excellence of structure, imagery,
and color that give them quite the quality of poetry,
though again, it must be observed, they are evangelical,
rather than universal, in scope and sweep. Anna Louisa
Walker is famous as the author of the hymn <span class='it'>Work, For
The Night Is Coming</span>. This is really a ‘sacred folk-song.’
It has indeed a wide popularity, but by no means as wide
as Scriven’s world-famous hymn. Albert Durrant Watson
and Alexander Louis Fraser are hymn writers of distinction.
Summarily: Canadian Hymn Writers have contributed
substantially to the hymnody of the Evangelical
Church in Canada, and, at least in two instances, to permanent
hymnody. But no Canadian hymn has the structural
beauty and spiritual sublimation which belong to
such hymns as Newman’s <span class='it'>Lead, Kindly Light</span>, or Baring-Gould’s
<span class='it'>Onward, Christian Soldiers</span>, or Lyte’s <span class='it'>Abide With
Me</span>, and which lift these hymns into the realm of authentic
poetry.</p>

<h3>Literary Criticism</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>LITERARY CRITICISM IN CANADA—SCHOOLS, AIMS, METHODS,
AND DEFECTS—NEW SYNOPTIC METHOD APPLIED TO POETRY
OF OVERSEAS DOMINIONS.</p>
</div>

<h4><span class='it'>I. Schools of Literary Criticism.</span></h4>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span><span class='sc'>n</span> an old country, like England, which long has had established
standards of taste and refined artistry, literary
criticism is a fine art. The essays in criticism by Coleridge,
Hazlitt, Arnold, Pater, Arthur Symons, Gilbert Chesterton,
Mackail, Ker, and others are polite, disinterested,
humane, and delightful in themselves. They have an intrinsic
charm of thought and style. They are literature.
In a young country, like Canada, when, in pioneer days,
the people were necessarily preoccupied wholly with practical
living and material civilization, and few were cultured
and none had leisure for cultivating taste, literary criticism,
if it existed, was exotic and traditional. Later, when
the people are still primarily occupied with material civilization
but decent culture is distributed and there is leisure
for cultivating taste, literary criticism becomes imitative
but academic, and, sometimes, is in the manner of the
dilettante. Finally, when the people of a young country
become conscious that they have a native literature and indigenous
standards of taste but are in doubt about the
status of their literature and the aesthetic dignity of their
literary taste, literary criticism becomes pragmatic or pedagogical
or philosophical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In its first stage literary criticism in a young country
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span>
attempts to <span class='it'>appraise</span>, by exotic, traditional standards, foreign
literature. Such criticism has no communal value.
It is not disinterested but personal. It only exhibits, as it
was intended to do, the fine taste and style of the critics.
In its pragmatic stage literary criticism in a young country
attempts to <span class='it'>praise</span> native literature, so as to win for this
literature the appreciation of the people in the land in
which it was produced and, secondarily, the decent regard
of foreign men of letters. The matter of such pragmatic
criticism always counts most, or for more than the manner
or style. It aims to be constructive. But because it is
self-conscious, self-reliant, and ardent, its praise tends to
be too high and its condemnation too severe. In the final
stage literary criticism becomes less self-conscious, less
ardent, and more detached and philosophical towards native
literature. It takes a synoptic view of the whole civilization
and culture which the native literature of a young
country embodies and interprets. It looks first to this
literature as an entity by itself and next regards it from
the point of view of absolute or long established standards.
It judges the native poetry and prose of a young country
by their relative importance to the people of that country
itself, and by its dignity as a contribution to world-literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are the stages in evolution of Literary Criticism
in Canada. Progressively there arose four Schools of
Criticism—the Traditional, the Academic or Dilettante,
the Pragmatic or Pedagogical, and the Synoptic or Philosophical.
But the fourth is not so much a new School
as it is the Pragmatic School with a broader and more
philosophical application of its aims and methods. All
these distinctions, however, are themselves pedagogical.
The members of the various Schools commingle aesthetic,
academic, and pragmatic methods in the same essay, for
the reason that in Canada criticism has been compelled,
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>
as it still is compelled, to be primarily a cultural agency, and
could never aim to be literature, wholly delectable in itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Traditional School has passed but it was represented
by such deceased critics as George Stewart, John
Reade, George Murray, and Martin Griffin. The Academic
or Dilettante School is represented by Professors
James Cappon, W. J. Alexander, Pelham Edgar, and Archibald
MacMechan, and by Sir Andrew Macphail, and Arnold
Haultain; and the Pragmatic School, by T. G. Marquis,
Miss Jean Graham, Miss Marjory MacMurchy, Katherine
Hale (Mrs. John Garvin), Donald G. French, Melvin O.
Hammond, R. H. Hathaway, J. D. Logan, and Bernard
Muddiman. The Synoptic School, which, too, is pragmatic
but also philosophical, is represented by Ray Palmer
Baker, author of <span class='it'>A History of English-Canadian Literature
to Confederation</span> and by the author of the present work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the aims and methods of the members of the
Traditional and the Academic Schools:—In general, Reade
and Griffin wrote critically, to illuminate universal literature
(poetry, fiction, drama, social life, and history). The
members of the Academic or Dilettante School have, on the
whole, the same aim, but sometimes they write critical essays
as a fine art in the department of <span class='it'>belles-lettres</span>. Reade
and Griffin wrote on literature and life in brief but scholarly
journalistic essays. Professors Cappon, Alexander,
Edgar, and MacMechan wrote or write monographs (as,
for instance, Cappon’s fine study of the poetry of C. G.
D. Roberts) or critical introductions and prefatory essays
to selected English men of letters (as, for instance, Alexander’s
admirable <span class='it'>Introduction to Browning</span> or MacMechan’s
scholarly Introductions to his <span class='it'>Selections from
Tennyson</span> and Carlyle’s <span class='it'>Sartor Resartus</span>). Dr. Macphail
and Mr. Haultain delight in the critical essay for its own
sake, and are more solicitous about beauty or dignity of
style than about substance or thought. Their essays belong
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>
to the department of <span class='it'>belles-lettres</span>—not always and
not essentially, but in tendency, form, and aesthetic dignity
or style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In particular, whenever the members of the first two
schools have written about any phase of the literary history
and the literature of Canada, or about any author who
has figured notably in that history and literature, they have
been rigorously aesthetic and critical. But the writers of
the Traditional School differ from those of the Academic
or Dilettante School in critical attitude to Canadian literature
and literary history. Reade and Griffin wrote sympathetically,
and with sincere admiration, about phases of
Canadian Literature; but they showed little or no understanding
of the historic process in the evolution of Canadian
culture, of the continuity of Canadian literary history.
How, then, could they have been more than merely aesthetic—how
could they have been genuinely critical—if
they had not the philosophic eye, did not look before and
after, and thus did not treat the phases of Canadian Literature
from the point of view of its implied relations to the
whole of Canadian life and of English literature, of which
Canadian verse and prose form a part? Sympathetically,
politely, and charmingly as Reade wrote about the phases
of Canadian Literature, his criticism, to employ a phrase
of M. Jules Lemaitre, was ‘not criticism, but entertaining
conversation.’ Virtually it denied that Canada possessed
a literature, a body of poetry and prose which should be
regarded as a real integer, having unity of inspiration and
a continuous growth from crude thought and form to respectable
aesthetic and artistic dignity. It implied only
that in the literature of Canada there are no ‘highways,’
but only pleasant ‘by-ways’ which invite the essayist to
write of them with aesthetic appreciation. This is not
philosophical, not genuine, criticism; it is polite, entertaining
conversation. For the problem of Canadian literary
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>
criticism is not the question whether Canada has produced,
intermittently and here and there, some original authors who
have composed poetry and prose as aesthetically winning
and as artistically beautiful or dignified as that of British
and American writers, but whether the Dominion has produced
a continuous body of poetry and prose, which, at its
best, may justly be considered genuine literature, worthy
to be regarded, as American literature is regarded, as a
living branch of English Literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the members of the Academic School take the
strictly aesthetic attitude to Canadian Literature, and show
little or no appreciation of the historic process in the evolution
of Canadian culture, they differ even in aesthetic attitude
from their predecessors. They are rather dogmatic
and patronizing towards Canadian prose and poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the aims and methods of the Pragmatic School:—The
members of this school have for their central principle
or chief article of faith the proposition that Canada has
a worthy body of authentic literature, which is being perennially
enhanced in quantity and in quality. For their
second principle they hold to the proposition that Canadian
literary critics must more or less intimately know the history—the
social and spiritual origins, ideals, and evolution—of
Canadian Literature. For their third principle they
have the proposition that the independent, sincere, honest,
and really serviceable literary critic to-day must be constructive
and pedagogic in method. They do not write
literary criticism which is meant to be literature itself, intrinsically
aesthetic, or pleasantly engaging reading on its
own account. They call their essays, whether a journalistic
review or editorial, or a magazine article, constructive
criticism. Their critical writings are, in the Greek sense,
pragmatic. For the chief aims of the Canadian constructive
critics are these two: first, to make plain and indubitable
to their compatriots and the world that Canada has
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
a really respectable body of literature; secondly, to appraise
new works of verse and prose by Canadians and to determine
the status of their worth in the permanent literature
of Canada. Canadian constructive critics have also
a third aim. It is pedagogical: to teach the people a decent
knowledge of the literary history of Canada and an aesthetic
appreciation of Canadian poetry and prose. The
members of the Pragmatic School all write with knowledge
of their subject, with literary dignity, thoughtfully, and, on
the whole, convincingly and effectively. Their systematic
and ardent championing of the cause of Canadian Literature
has had a three-fold result. It has led to establishment
of regular courses in the study of Canadian Literature in
the universities and colleges of the Dominion and in some
universities of the United States, to a wider study and appreciation
of Canadian Literature on the part of the people,
and to finer critical and creative writing by Canadian men
and women of letters.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>II. The Synoptic Method.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>Literary criticism in Canada has had two faults. It
was <span class='it'>vicarious</span>—an echo of foreign criticism which was
patronizing and insincere, and, therefore, untrue and harmful.
It was too <span class='it'>inclusive</span> in conspectus and standards, for
Canadian poetry and prose were critically compared with
classical English Literature. This was to write criticism
without perspective and without respect to a hierarchy of
values. It was supererogatory and therefore futile. Even
the Pragmatic School of Canadian literary critics did not
wholly escape this second fault. It will result better for
the advancement of Canadian Criticism if the literatures
of the British Overseas Dominions—Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, Tasmania, South Africa—are compared
amongst themselves; and if thus the status of each relatively
in the literature of the Empire is critically determined.
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>By this method of comparing child with child, and not
the child with the parent, the literary historian shows how
worthily Canadian poetry and prose compare with other
Overseas poetry and prose, and what right Canadian and
other Overseas literature have to be considered respectable
branches of the literature of the Empire. A comparative
appreciation of the Poetry of Canada and the other Overseas
Dominions will suffice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Canadians have not written ‘great’ poetry, they have
written poetry in which, as Mr. E. B. Osborn, of the
London <span class='it'>Morning Post</span>, says, ‘the most exacting critic can
find something to admire.’ The problem of literary criticism
in Canada to-day is not whether Canada has produced
or is producing ‘great poetry,’ but whether it has produced
or is producing good poetry, consistently with its grade of
culture, civilization and national inspirations and aspirations—poetry
that can genuinely be admired and that deserves
to be preserved. To observe that Canada has produced
good poetry, near-great poetry, is not, as many
Canadians seem to feel it is, to damn it with faint praise,
but sensibly to evaluate it. Those native critics who ignore
Canadian poetry because, as they think, it is not ‘great’
poetry and is, therefore, not ‘real’ poetry or not poetry
worthy of the name of literature, are maladroit logicians.
Those other native critics who discover Coleridge reincarnated
in Bliss Carman, Tennyson in Roberts, Keats in
Lampman, Matthew Arnold in Duncan Campbell Scott,
Kipling in Service are damning Canadian poetry with
superobese praise. The truth is that Canada has produced
systematic poets who have written much poetry that is
good, some that is super-excellent, and some rare examples
that are near the perfection which entitles them, in their
kind, to be ranked as really great.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canadian poetry, in variety of theme or species, and
in technical finish, naturally might be presumed to be
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>
superior to that of Australia, New Zealand, or South Africa.
In a literary way, Canada is not much, if at all,
older than Australia. Both countries depend on England
for their literary standards and poetic forms. But in
changes of seasons and their effects on the beauty and call
of objective Nature, Canada has greater variety, and
Nature makes a deeper impress on the soul, than is possible
by climatic changes and Nature’s varying face and garb
in Australia. Moreover, Canada has a unique background
of romantic history which affords Canadian poets special
opportunities to incorporate romantic and heroic material
in their poetry, or to suffuse it with the glamor of romance.
Australia has not this romantic history, and Australian
poets, therefore, have less opportunity to make their descriptive
and narrative poetry interesting or entrancing by
way of romantic glamor. Again: Canada has had several
internal or national crises which have had a distinct effect
on the conscience of the Canadian people—creating in
them a sense of solidarity, evoking a national consciousness,
and filling them with national aspirations and an intense
desire to work out their own destiny. Australia has not
had any such internal crises; and, it is, therefore, not to be
expected that Australian poetry will be noted for peculiar,
intense, or profound expressions of the sense of nationality
and of destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while in Canada the literature most in popular demand
is imaginative prose, and while the majority of
readers are virtually perusers of prose fiction, in Australia
the readers and writers of poetry are legion or, as one critic
has put it, ‘poetry out there is a national habit.’ Mr. Arthur
Adams, an Australian editor, has stated that while he
was always certain of getting good verse from contributors,
he was never certain of getting a good story. It has been
quite the other way in Canada—an editor is practically
certain of getting a good piece of prose or a good story,
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>
and never sure of getting a technically worthy poem, or
even verse which might by courtesy be called poetry. In
Canada, with the exception of the enormous sales of Service’s
volumes and W. H. Drummond’s <span class='it'>habitant</span> verse,
Canadian poets have had to be content with very small
editions, and even some of these had many left-over copies,
absolutely unsaleable. In Australia the sale of poetry—of
large successive editions of the poems of Adam Lindsay
Gordon, Henry Lawson, Will H. Ogilvie, A. B. Patterson,
C. J. Dennis, the latter’s running beyond 100,000 copies
in 1917—is a literary phenomenon by itself; and goes to
prove that in Australia the reading and the writing of
poetry are virtually national habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the sides, then, of romantic historical backgrounds,
practical or social crises, and variety, beauty, and sublimity
of Nature, Canada was naturally fitted to produce a larger
and more impressive body of poetry than was Australia.
But as a matter of fact, in at least two respects, Australian
poetry rather surpasses Canadian. Canadian poets never
had a waiting and avid body of readers. Australian poets
had precisely such a <span class='it'>clientèle</span>. This means that in Canada
poetry would not be written with the consciousness of a
critical public in mind—a public that would as readily reject
or condemn poetry which was not satisfactory as it
would accept and praise poetry which satisfied, whereas in
Australia poetry would be written consciously aiming at
pleasing and satisfying a critical public of readers. In
other words, while Canadian poets had only foreign or
English standards, and practically no domestic standards
or <span class='it'>clientèle</span>, Australian poets had both foreign and domestic
standards and a very large and responsive domestic public
of readers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result was that while in Canada the general run
of poetry was technically indifferent, at least until the rise
of the Systematic School, in Australia the run of poetry,
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>
irrespective of the themes, was technically better finished
than the Canadian. The Canadians did not seem to write
with a consciousness of English standards and criticism.
Their poetry was only for home consumption—and the
substance counted more than the form or style. The Australians,
as poets, on the whole were more cultured than
the Canadians and wrote their verse as if distinctly conscious
that it would be seen and read in England, and
judged according to rigorous English standards, because
regarded as written by <span class='it'>absentee</span> Englishmen. Australian
verse was written more for English readers than for home
readers. But the home readers also read with English standards
in view—even though the themes were Australian,
horse-racing and other picaresque life or the more dignified
themes of Nature’s loveliness, Nature’s immensities, or
tragic death in the wilderness. Hence, on the whole, Australian
poetry actually shows a better <span class='it'>technical</span> finish than
does Canadian poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canadian and Australian poets naturally produced verse
which is marked by fervid nature-painting and by realistic
pictures of pioneer and wild romantic social life. But in
fine nature-painting the Canadians surpass the Australians.
Both in color from Nature (Canadian poets have the larger,
more varied palette) and in technical artistry Australia has
not produced a poet of the quality of Lampman, Wilfred
Campbell, or Duncan Campbell Scott. Nor when it comes
to envisaging the <span class='it'>moods</span> of Nature and the open-road, has
Australia produced a poet of the lyrical quality of Bliss
Carman. Canada’s Nature-painters are superb <span class='it'>artists</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Australian poets have their <span class='it'>forte</span>. In realistic
pictures of rough or pioneer social life, they surpass the
Canadian poets. The Canadian poet Drummond, of
course, stands in a class by himself, inasmuch as his poetry
of the <span class='it'>habitant</span> and <span class='it'>voyageur</span> was a field pre-empted by him
and inasmuch as his poetry in this field is devoted to picturesque
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>
revealment of the <span class='it'>humanity</span>—the pathos and
humor—of the thought, speech and simple life—of a peculiar
but morally worthy people. There is nothing melodramatic
in Drummond’s poetry. It is genuinely humanized
verse about a genuinely human people. Service’s Western
and Northern Canadian verse, on the contrary, is the poetry
of picaresque melodrama. The best ballads of the Australian
poets of rough or pioneer life, A. L. Gordon, A. B.
Patterson, Henry Lawson, C. J. Dennis, are authentic
poetry. In remarking the distinction between the Australian
and the Canadian poets of rude or picaresque life,
Mr. E. B. Osborn truthfully says: ‘Some of the poems in
his [Service’s] last volume are a <span class='it'>near approach</span> to the
Australian realism, which avoids the melodramatic and the
splashing of anapests as far as possible and makes use of
the quiet-curtain. So far the manly adventurous poets of
Canada [Service, Stead, McInnes, Fraser, <span class='it'>et al.</span>] have not
progressed far beyond the Adam Lindsay Gordon convention.
As yet none of the Western Canadian poets see that
<span class='it'>style</span> is the only antiseptic and, as artists, they are far behind
the Australians and compare unfavorably with the
minor masters of Quebec.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>What has been said regarding the technical finish of
Australian verse applies also to the verse of New Zealand
and of South Africa, and to the latter with even more
truth. For all the South African poets happened to be men
and women of culture. Thomas Pringle was a man of
rare and refined culture. So are Arthur Cripps, R. C.
Russell, John Runcie, Mrs. Beatrice Bromley, W. C. Scully,
and a score of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What, then, is the status of Canadian poetry in the
poetry of the Empire? Canadian nature-poetry, in
variety of theme, substance, color, imagery and artistry, at
its best, surpasses that of the other Dominions. Much of
Overseas poetry is concerned with social life. In the past
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>
Canadians displayed an insistent sense of a call to work
out their own destiny, and a profound pride in the resources
and institutions of their country. In the verse of Canadian
poets the ‘note’ in this regard is somewhat too insistent,
almost strident. But the stridency of the national ‘note’
is nothing compared with another defect. The moral
earnestness of Canadian poets is so obtrusive that it either
causes a neglect of form in order to get the important thing
said, or it effervesces in insincere and melodramatic utterances.
Australian, New Zealand, and South African poets
do not exhibit the same intense consciousness nationality
and destiny. They still hold to the idea of the Motherland,
still feel their connection with the Old Country. For this
reason they write of social life in their respective countries
with more objectivity than do the Canadians, revealing the
joys and humor and pathos of life with a realism that is
veracious and sincere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far no Overseas poetry, Canadian or other, has
contributed anything novel or original to the forms and
aesthetic values of English poetry. In this respect no
Overseas poetry is ‘great’ poetry, although much of it is
genuinely ‘real’ and excellent poetry. But in aesthetic
content, as in its Nature-painting or Nature-psychology,
and in moral substance, all Overseas poetry—all the best of
it—is admirable. Canadian poetry, however, ranks highest,
particularly in self-reliance, in faith in the land and the
people, in serenity and a profound trust in the providential
government of nations that love righteousness and pursue it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Summarily: Canadian poetry, excepting the realism of
Service, is the sincerest poetry written in the Overseas
Dominions of the British Empire. It is not always the
most joyous, the most winning, the most moving, or the
most transporting. But it is the most sincere and serene,
and, therefore, the most satisfying, verse in the poetry of
the British Overseas Dominions.</p>

<h3>Essayists <span class='it'>and</span> Color Writers</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>THE ESSAYISTS AND COLOR WRITERS OF CANADA—CARMAN—MACMECHAN—BLAKE—KATHERINE
HALE—KING—DEACON—LEACOCK.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>C</span><span class='sc'>anadian</span> essays, familiar studies of life and manners,
or essays in <span class='it'>belles lettres</span>, are too meagre in
quantity and too ephemeral or slight in aesthetic substance
as yet to be significant. Pure criticism of fine arts, including
literature, is also slight in quantity and insignificant in
form and substance. Both literary criticism and essays in
<span class='it'>belles-lettres</span> are possible only under certain social and mental
conditions. There must be a considerable degree of
economic independence and leisure so as to permit writers
to view Nature and existence with detachment. The
writers themselves must be specially gifted with a light
literary touch, a delicate sensibility to impressions from
Nature and character, and a refined sense of the relative
values of good and evil, tragedy and comedy, in the world,
a whimsical or gracious humor and a faculty for gentle
revery. In short, detachment, an eye for beauty in Nature
and the human spirit and a genuine humor are necessary
in writers who would achieve distinction in the field of the
Familiar Essay and in Belletristic Literature. In Canada,
however, where life is strenuous and where men and women
must take pragmatic or moralistic attitudes to existence,
detachment, humor, and a light touch are rarely possible.
The result is that the belletristic literature of Canada is
slight and as yet insignificant.
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The most notable work of the kind appears to be the
essays of Bliss Carman. He has published four volumes,
considerable in quantity, on the philosophy of Nature and
the Spirit, distinguished by a clear, well-knit, and readable
prose style, and rich in poetic suggestiveness and spiritual
power. These volumes are <span class='it'>The Kinship of Nature</span>, <span class='it'>The
Friendship of Art</span>, <span class='it'>The Poetry of Life</span>, and <span class='it'>The Making
of Personality</span>. Plato, the Greek Gnostics and Mystics,
and the Transcendentalism of Emerson informed Carman’s
heart and sublimated his imagination pantheistically and
mystically. Carman applied his poetic imagination to a
special philosophical interpretation and appreciation of
Man’s kinship with Nature, and of the metaphysical meaning
of the human personality or spirit in its relation to
Nature and the universe. In truth, Carman’s prose and
poetry are related as the converse and obverse sides of his
inner being. Indeed the secret of the inner springs of his
lyricism is to be discovered beautifully, lyrically, expressed
in his prose essays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Carman’s essays are not prose poetry. He did not
attempt, as Roberts attempted in his prose, to write impressionistic
prose. Carman does not aim at mere color-writing
for its own sake. What he attempts and achieves
is a subtle analysis of the history of the spirit in its relations
to man and to God and the whole universe. Because this
was his aim, Carman was solicitous about his style—especially
about clarity of diction and pure beauty of imagery,
and about the simplicity and readableness of the structure
of his sentences. In short, Carman’s prose style has
the same simplicity and directness and chaste beauty of
imagery and spiritual exaltation which we find in his lyrics.
For this reason we may signalize Carman’s prose as ‘lyrical’
prose. But we are by no means to allow this epithet to
connote anything like sensuous impressionism or vague
imagination. It is all solid, if sublimated, thought about
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>
profound matters, addressed to the imaginative reason or
the religious imagination, and addressed in a style so clear
and direct and so emotionally pure that it affects the heart
and the imagination lyrically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An essayist in another style is Archibald MacMechan.
Dr. MacMechan has published two volumes, <span class='it'>The Porter
of Bagdad</span> (1901) and <span class='it'>The Life of a Little College</span> (1914);
and he has published several booklets of essays in a series
of ‘chap books.’ Dr. MacMechan is unsurpassed in Canada
as a writer of the Light Essay. He differs of course from
Carman in bent of genius as an essayist. Carman employs
the religious or metaphysical imagination and appeals to
our sensibilities. Dr. MacMechan employs the fancy. His
essays are essentially, as he indicates in the title of <span class='it'>The
Porter of Bagdad</span>, ‘fantasies’ or reveries. His style has a
lightness of touch which is inviting and ingratiating, and
he has a delicate and pleasant gift of humor. He is hardly
Addisonian, but the substance of his essays, their diction,
and the movement of his sentences engage the attention
and delight the sense of form with the readiness and pleasant
intrigue of the essays of Addison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not in so light a style and not with such playful fancy
as Dr. MacMechan’s are the essays of W. H. Blake, widely
known as the translator of Louis Hémon’s romantic idyll
of French Canada, <span class='it'>Maria Chapdelaine</span>. Mr. Blake’s
<span class='it'>Brown Waters and Other Sketches</span>, <span class='it'>In a Fishing Country</span>,
and <span class='it'>A Fisherman’s Luck</span> indicate the scope and method of
his essays. They are ‘sketches’ of objective experiences.
They are not fantasies or reveries. The intellect, rather
than the fancy, is the creative faculty most employed in
them. Mr. Blake’s essays, therefore, have not the lightness
and the limpidity of MacMechan’s but they contain happy
revealments of Nature in Canada and of the human spirit
against a background of Nature. At times, they contain
patches of engaging ‘color-writing.’
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the field of systematic ‘color-writing’ Katherine Hale
is an artist by herself. In aesthetic criticism Katherine
Hale’s <span class='it'>forte</span> had always been a gift of causing the imagination
and sensibilities to appreciate one art, say, music, in
terms of another art, say, painting. Her musical criticism
is not musical, but <span class='it'>literary impressionism</span>. Its effect all
depends upon suggestion, particularly suggestion of color.
When, therefore, Katherine Hale turned to employ her pictorial
imagination in a field where the sense of color in
Nature and of the ‘color of life’ would be absolutely free
and directly at home, she produced work which is unique
in its kind, as in her <span class='it'>Canadian Cities of Romance</span> (1922).
The romance in this case is not the romance of sentiment
and of wonder and of curiosity. It is the romance that
exists for the eyes which perceive beauty in ancient by-ways,
strange and eerie places, and in the dress, manners and
habits of peculiar peoples in towns and cities which still retain
a residue of an old and lost civilization and culture.
Her <span class='it'>Canadian Cities of Romance</span> is a book by which to
transport the pictorial imagination and to win the imaginative
eye with aesthetic delights of ‘color’ in character,
incident, and the dramatic movement of life. Her literary
style is piquant, swift-moving, realistically faithful and yet
suffused with tints from Nature’s palette and with imaginative
light. Its analogue is found in the travel essays of
E. V. Lucas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another form of the Essay, namely, the Practical,
Reflective Essay, very little has been achieved, because
rarely attempted, in Canada. Canadians do not seem to
have the same desire as their cousins in the United States
for homilies or practical preachments on the secret of
‘getting along’ in the world. An excellent, if singular, example
of the Practical, Reflective Essay is <span class='it'>The Secret of
Heroism</span> by the Rt. Hon. MacKenzie King, Premier of
Canada. <span class='it'>The Secret of Heroism</span> is a biography of a human
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>
spirit, which, having served nobly on earth, passed, and in
passing left the effluence of his life, which is still potent, to
win men to the love of ‘otherworldliness.’ Aside from the
matter, it is notable as an example of what is rare in Canadian
prose, namely, ‘infused’ style, which requires that the
matter and the form, the thought and the expression, be
indivisible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pragmatic people, as are the Canadians, have little or
no taste for the Whimsical Essay. The matter of the
whimsical essay counts for nothing. Its appeal is altogether
by way of piquancy in what is said. Piquancy—not
mordancy! For mordancy would only make what is
said satiric, and cause pain. The whimsical essay must
cause mere smiles and chuckles. It must be <span class='it'>clever</span>—and
nothing more. Canadians are beginning to turn more and
more to this form of Essay. Its character and manner
are well exemplified in William A. Deacon’s <span class='it'>Pens and
Pirates</span> (1923). The essays in this volume have novelty
of theme, over which plays precisely the light of a ‘whimsical’
fancy and humor. They are informed, however,
with the strictly literary color of allusion and quotation
from the poets and prosemen of all ages to the present,
but in such an incidental and light way that there is no
show of pedantry. The allusion and quotation are natural
to Mr. Deacon’s professional office as a reviewer of contemporary
literature. His style is journalistic in the
French sense—‘style <span class='it'>coupe</span>’—as regards sentence length.
But he adds a piquancy to it which makes it somewhat
‘winged’ and which thus pleasantly engages the sensibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No Canadian as yet has appeared as a systematic writer
of the Critical Essay. Such essays of this genre as were
published have been ‘fugitive,’ and their aim and method
have been pragmatic and pedagogical rather than literary.
There is, however, much room and great need in Canada
for systematic Essays in Criticism which shall have dignity
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>
of thought, imaginative light, and grace or power of style,
and which in themselves shall be literature. Thomas
O’Hagan’s Essays in <span class='it'>Canadian Literature</span> are too fragmentary
and didactic to be literature, though they are
literary. L. J. Burpee’s <span class='it'>A Little Book of Canadian Essays</span>
contains brief but illuminating critical studies of seven
Canadian writers. Stephen Leacock’s <span class='it'>Essays and Literary
Studies</span> are too heterogeneous in theme and too variable
(perhaps variegated) in style to be credited with the dignity
of systematic Essays in Criticism. They are interesting
but not weighty literary ‘Studies.’ The master critic has
yet to appear in Canada.</p>

<h3>Anthologies</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>CANADIAN BIRTHDAY BOOK (SERANUS)—DEWART’s SELECTIONS
FROM CANADIAN POETS—LIGHTHALL’S ‘SONGS OF THE
GREAT DOMINION’—OXFORD BOOK OF CANADIAN VERSE—GARVIN’S
CANADIAN POETS, ETC.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>E</span><span class='sc'>very</span> anthology of national literature must be
critically appreciated from the point of view of the
aim of the author. Properly, according to the roots of the
word anthology, care, and even fastidiousness, are implied
on the part of the compiler. The world-famous collection of
Greek verse known as <span class='it'>The Greek Anthology</span> is properly, that
is both etymologically and aesthetically, an ‘anthology.’
For the poems in it were most carefully chosen before being
collected together; and they were selected strictly according
to ideals of beauty in thought and expression. So
that the term anthology hardly if ever applies strictly to
the so called anthologies of Canadian verse. As a matter
of fact such collections of Canadian verse as have been compiled,
actually do not bear the title anthology; they bear
some such title as ‘A Treasury,’ or ‘A Wreath,’ or ‘Flowers,’
of Canadian Verse. Sometimes the collections have the
plainest of practical titles, such as <span class='it'>Canadian Poets</span> or <span class='it'>Canadian
Singers and Their Songs</span>, or <span class='it'>The Oxford Book of
Canadian Verse</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is quite irrelevant and an elaboration of the obvious
to dispraise, as some Canadian critics have done, the contents
of certain anthologies of Canadian poetry, as of ‘unequal
merit.’ They might as well say that the culture and
the cultural institutions of Canada are of ‘unequal
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>
merit.’ Relatively to the poetry of old civilizations the
poetry of Canada is poor or mediocre or indifferent or fine
in aesthetic substance and artistic structure and form according
to the culture and genius of the country’s poets.
Secondly, all Canadian anthologies, whether the aim was to
select the very best of the very best poetry or to select
representative poems from each period or all periods, contain
poetry which is not all on the same level of excellence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first anthology to engage public attention and to
win critical appreciation was a book which now belongs to
the <span class='it'>rarissimae</span> of collectors of ‘Canadiana,’ namely, <span class='it'>The
Canadian Birthday Book</span>, by ‘Seranus’ (pseudonym of
Mrs. S. Frances Harrison), published at Toronto in 1887.
It was compiled, with exquisite taste, in both English and
French; and it is notable for the fact that its selections date
as far back as the year 1732, with a poem by Jean Taché
who, as the compiler has said in her notes, is ‘probably the
first French-Canadian poet to publish.’ It is notable also
for the fact that it contains some verses by the Indian Chief
Tecumseh, and is, likewise, one of the earliest volumes to
contain the work of such poets as Bliss Carman, Wilfred
Campbell, Pauline Johnson, and Archibald Lampman. In
a real sense, that is, in the Greek sense of the term, the
<span class='it'>Canadian Birthday Book</span> is the first Canadian anthology.
The poems in it, are dainty in themselves and the artistry
of the poems also is dainty—‘little flowers’ of pretty or
beautiful Canadian verse, pioneer, <span class='it'>émigré</span>, nativistic, and
native and national.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty years before the appearance of Seranus’ miniature
anthology Rev. Edward Hartley Dewart published, under
the plain title of <span class='it'>Selections From Canadian Poetry</span>,
what may be called the first treasury of Canadian verse
(1864). Dewart’s <span class='it'>Selections</span> was simply a ‘collection’
of poems for ‘good reading,’ or for pedagogical purposes
in the Provinces of Canada. It was not intended to be
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>
received as literary anthology, but only as a volume of
representative poems from the earlier periods of Canadian
history up to the year of publication. Its audience was
limited to Canada and it had only local or provincial appreciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next anthology was W. D. Lighthall’s <span class='it'>Songs of
the Great Dominion</span> (1889). It was informed with the
Canadian outlook on life and national achievement within
the twenty years after the formation of the Confederacy,
and with the Canadian prevision of a national destiny which
seemed implied in the genius of the Canadian people for
autonomous government, in the vast resources of the
Dominion, and in the relations which would inevitably develop
between Canada and the United States and the other
nations of the world. The aim of Dr. Lighthall was both
literary and pragmatic. He desired to present to the
English-speaking world the ideals and genius of Canada
as these ideals and genius were embodied and expressed
in the best poetry by <span class='it'>émigré</span> and by native-born Canadian
poets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Lighthall’s inclusive and pragmatic aim determines
both the scope and the method of his aptly named <span class='it'>Songs
of the Great Dominion</span>. In his Introduction he carefully
explains the scope and method of his anthology. The
order of this collection is in sections, treating of the
Imperial Spirit, the New Nationality, the Indian, the <span class='it'>Voyageur</span>
and <span class='it'>Habitant</span>, Settlement Life, Sports and Free Life,
Historical Incidents, Places and Seasons. He says: They
give merely, it should be understood, a sketch of the range
of the subjects. Canadian history, for example, as any one
acquainted with Parkman will know, perfectly teems with
noble deeds and great events, of which only a small share
have been sung, whereof there is only space here for a
much smaller share. The Northwest and British
Columbia, that Pacific clime of charm—the gold-diggings
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>
Province, land of salmon rivers, and of the Douglas firs
which hide daylight at noonday—have been scarcely sung
at all, owing to their newness. The poetry of the Winter
Carnival, splendid scenic spectacle of gay Northern arts
and delights, is only rudimentary also. Those who have
been present at the thrilling spectacle of the nocturnal
storming of the Ice Palace in Montreal, when the whole
city, dressing itself in the picturesque snow-shoe costume
and arraying its streets in lights and colors, rises as one
man in a tumultuous enthusiasm, must feel that something
of a future lies before the poetry of these strange
and wonderful elements.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Lighthall in his <span class='it'>Songs of the Great Dominion</span>
attempts to do is not to present us with a mere quantity
of Canadian poetry which we may receive with delight or
reject, but to invite us to the home of the Canadian National
Spirit and to show us what the Canadian spirit, as it is
envisaged and expressed in the poetry of the Dominion
since Confederation, has achieved and means to achieve.
One who reads Lighthall’s anthology cannot escape catching
in it glimpses of the essential Canadian spirit. In the
poems in Lighthall’s volume the Canadian spirit sings
clearly its full gamut. We hear the ‘notes’ always of
courage; of self-reliance; of hope; of exultation; and of
good cheer and serenity; and these notes of courage and
faith and exultation and indomitable will and heroism and
good cheer and peace in the heart of man in Canada <span class='it'>are
but the antiphons to the voices of the land and the sea and
the forest, the great waters and the sky and the maples, and
elms in their strength and also in their gentler and peaceful
humors</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Canadian spirit, as evisaged and expressed in the
<span class='it'>Songs of the Great Dominion</span>, is manly; and the supreme
quality of the poetry in Lighthall’s anthology is the quality
of <span class='it'>manliness</span>. But this is a moral quality. What of the
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
aesthetic quality of the <span class='it'>Songs of the Great Dominion</span>?
Agreeing that poets should rise and drop with their subjects,
we note a high level of excellence in thought and in craftsmanship
in the poems in Lighthall’s volume. Considering
its scope and the variety of the subjects and styles of
form in the volume, and considering also its expression of
the full gamut of the notes of the Canadian spirit, Lighthall’s
<span class='it'>Songs of the Great Dominion</span> not only implies a kind
of creative vision and imagination on the part of the compiler,
but distinctly and unmistakably appeals to the same
faculties in the reader. In other words, Lighthall’s volume
delights the heart and the imagination by way of the intrinsic
beauty and the moral substance of the poetry in it;
but it delights more the constructive imagination of the
reader by way of the illumination it sheds on the essential
nature, will, and ideals of the Canadian spirit, of the Canadian
people. It differs in this constructive way from all
anthologies of Canadian verse that have preceded it and all
that have followed it. In short, Lighthall’s <span class='it'>Songs of the
Great Dominion</span>, on the side of embodying and expressing
spiritual essences, is unique amongst Canadian anthologies
of native and national poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Later Canadian Poems</span> (1893), edited by J. E.
Wetherell, is a much slighter volume than Lighthall’s but is
significant as an expression of the new spirit in Canadian
Literature, containing, as it does, the first publication of
some of the work of Bliss Carman, Charles G. D. Roberts,
Duncan Campbell Scott, and Pauline Johnson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It might have been expected that <span class='it'>The Oxford Book of
Canadian Verse</span> (1913), inasmuch as it was seemingly
compiled by Wilfred Campbell, one of the more important
poets of Canada, would be on the level of the ideal required
by the Oxford Press and superior to other anthologies of
Canadian verse. As a matter of fact <span class='it'>The Oxford Book of
Canadian Verse</span>, as originally compiled by Wilfred Campbell,
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>
was not according to the standard of the Oxford
Press. The necessary re-compilation was made by two
hands, Mr. S. B. Gundy, Canadian Representative of the
Oxford Press at Toronto, and J. D. Logan who selected
and added fifty poems (Nos. 211 to the end, inclusive)
from the work of the younger Canadian poets. Campbell’s
Oxford Press anthology has been frequently appreciated
as the best of the treasuries of Canadian poetry.
But how a volume of such fortuitous origin and construction
can be the best of the Canadian anthologies, passes
understanding. As an anthology <span class='it'>The Oxford Book</span> is
more than any of the other anthologies of Canadian verse
a volume of poetry ‘of unequal merit.’ But the defect
most conspicuous in the book is psychological rather than
artistic, spiritual rather than aesthetic. It contains 251
poems by 100 poets. It is the slightest of the three great
anthologies, and the most classical. Its contents have dignity,
taste, correctness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the other two chief anthologies—Theodore Harding
Rand’s <span class='it'>A Treasury of Canadian Verse</span> (1900) and John
W. Garvin’s <span class='it'>Canadian Poets</span> (1916)—the Rand anthology
was compiled from the point of view of the history, rather
than the aesthetics, of Canadian poetry, whereas the Garvin
anthology was compiled from the point of view of
modernity in the aesthetic substance and artistic construction
of Canadian poetry. Garvin’s volume contains the
work of only fifty-two poets, whereas Rand’s and Lighthall’s
contain the work of more than twice that number of
poets. Garvin’s volume is better suited to its century than
is any of the others. It is not only a repository of modern
Canadian poetry but also a critical <span class='it'>vade mecum</span> to 20th Century
Canadian poetry. For in addition to the poems in the
volume, each poet’s work is prefaced by a biographical
sketch and by critical appreciation or comment by others
than the compiler. The latter fact relieves the critical apparatus
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
itself of the charge of personal bias on the part of the
compiler. The Garvin anthology, again, is distinguished
by a peculiarity of singular spiritual import. It contains
nothing that is not <span class='it'>typical</span> of the Canadian national spirit
and Canadian civilization and culture. Lighthall’s volume,
despite its good sense and genuinely aesthetic quality, had
such variety and diversity of ‘notes’ of the spirit in it that
it is hard to distinguish which is the essential note, the typical
voice, and which the ‘overtones’ of the Canadian spirit.
<span class='it'>The Oxford Book</span>, again, is untypical of the Canadian
spirit by way of too many poems that are ‘poet’s poems’—too
much of art for art’s sake. But Garvin’s <span class='it'>Canadian
Poets</span> contains the work of such poets, both of the older
and the younger generation, as expresses the typical work
of each of the singers and the typical spirit of the Canadian
people. It is a companionable volume; and it has the distinct
advantage of biographical and critical comment, which
fit it, according to its scope, for private reading and enjoyment
and for critical study of the history of Canadian
poetry. In those regards Garvin’s <span class='it'>Canadian Poets</span> is an
anthology which is at once aesthetically satisfying and
pragmatically the most serviceable in the field that it covers.
Mr. Garvin is also the compiler of the only anthology of
the Canadian poetry of the Great War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several other anthologies of Canadian poetry require
no more notice here than to mention their names and scope.
L. J. Burpee’s <span class='it'>Flowers From a Canadian Garden</span> is a genuine
anthology in the Greek meaning of the term. It is a
bijou anthology containing seventy-five fastidiously selected
short lyrics, lovely ‘little flowers’ of Canadian poetry. The
selections in Mr. Burpee’s <span class='it'>A Century of Canadian Sonnets</span>
are also most carefully chosen. E. S. Caswell’s
<span class='it'>Canadian Singers and Their Songs</span> is a unique
volume of selected poems in fac-similes of the authors’
holograph manuscripts; and is illustrated with portraits of
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>
the authors of the poems. It is essentially a literary curiosity,
and meets the express design of the compiler, namely,
to produce a book of ‘personalia’ which would be appreciated
as a gift book. Mrs. C. M. Whyte Edgar’s <span class='it'>A
Wreath of Canadian Song</span> (1910) is too fragmentary in
the poetry which chiefly forms its substance to be considered
a genuine anthology. Moreover, it is limited to
the verse of Canadian poets who have died. Aesthetically
viewed it is a work of no significance; but it contains historical
and bibliographical data that is curious and useful
for critical purposes. <span class='it'>Our Canadian Literature</span> (1923)
is a collection of Canadian poetry and prose by Dr. Lorne
Pierce and Dr. A. D. Watson. It is much more valuable
as a reading course or class room textbook than as a
treasury of aesthetic poetry and prose. <span class='it'>A Book of Canadian
Verse and Prose</span> (1923) is the compilation of Professor
E. K. Broadus and Mrs. Broadus. It is a collection
of Canadian poetry and prose in English and French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of compilations of Canadian poetry and prose
have been made from time to time for school use. Among
these are <span class='it'>Patriotic Recitations and Arbor Day Exercises</span>,
by G. W. Ross; <span class='it'>Selections from Canadian Poets</span> and <span class='it'>Selections
from Canadian Prose</span>, both by E. A. Hardy; <span class='it'>The
Standard Canadian Reciter</span>, by Donald G. French; <span class='it'>The
Canadian Poetry Book</span>, by D. J. Dickie.</p>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'>CANADIAN JOURNALISM IN RELATION TO PERMANENT
CANADIAN LITERATURE; A SUMMARY CRITICAL HISTORY OF
THE CHIEF CANADIAN NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES.</p>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>he</span> question: Are Newspapers and Magazines literature?
has various answers, negative and affirmative.
There cannot be any doubt that Newspapers and Magazines
can be literature, because they have been literature; or that
Newspapers and Magazines promote literature, because
they have done this. The fact is that the first journalism
in English was at the very outset literature. <span class='it'>The Tatter</span>
and <span class='it'>The Spectator</span> were founded in the years 1709
and 1711, respectively. <span class='it'>The Rambler</span> was founded later.
These periodicals, whose pages were the popular reading
of the times, and whose pages were made ‘living epistles’
by the pens of Richard Steele, Joseph Addison, Samuel
Johnson, and Oliver Goldsmith—four of the greatest prose
writers of the 18th century—were the predecessors of the
modern Newspaper. Their pages, especially those of <span class='it'>The
Spectator</span>, combined the functions of a newspaper, a literary
miscellany and a review of society, life, and world
happenings. In particular, Joseph Addison was ‘the
father’ of the modern newspaper ‘leader’ and ‘editorial’ and
of the special article in theatrical and art criticism. Samuel
Johnson was the inventor of the modern ‘society page’ and
‘woman’s page’ as we know them in our day. In short,
Steele, Addison, Johnson, Goldsmith, Defoe and others of
considerable literary reputation in the 18th century were
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>
the creators of England’s first ‘people’s literature’—a journalistic
literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Journalism and Magazine writing in Canada began
with the same ideals of scope and literary dignity as obtained
in the days of Addison and Johnson in England.
The first newspaper to be established in any of the Provinces
which later became confederated in the Canadian
Union was <span class='it'>The Halifax Gazette</span> which was established at
Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1752; that is, 43 years after the
founding of <span class='it'>The Tatler</span>. The first magazine to be established
in Canada was published at Halifax in 1789 and was
named <span class='it'>The Nova Scotia Magazine</span>. As a newspaper, however,
<span class='it'>The Halifax Gazette</span> was devoted chiefly to the publication
of military and governmental intelligence. It was
not till Joseph Howe purchased <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span>, at Halifax,
in 1828, that journalism in Canada harked back to
the ideals of <span class='it'>The Tatler</span> and <span class='it'>The Spectator</span>. Joseph Howe
must be regarded as the first and foremost literary, as
well as practical, journalist in the history of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is sufficient here to remark Howe’s strict literary
ideals, even as a journalist, and to observe not only that in
his own journalistic writing he strove after literary form
and color, but also that in the writings of his contributors
he saw to it that there was a very considerable literary
flavor. His ideals were emulated by other Canadian
journalists, as for instance Etienne Parent, in Quebec, and
George Brown of the Toronto <span class='it'>Globe</span> and Charles Lindsey,
in Ontario, and by later journalists in Canada. Yet we
must here emphasize, for our own times, the inclusiveness
of the ideals which inspired Howe and which resulted in
his producing newspapers whose influence abides to this
day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By some sort of intuition, Howe knew, as Addison and
Steele before him knew, that the secrets of successful journalism
are two: <span class='it'>Variety</span> of interests in reading matter, and
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span>
<span class='it'>Readableness</span> or the power to hold the attention by the manner
or style of what is written. Howe also had aesthetic
and moral ideals. He aimed to produce journalism that
would entertain and at the same time improve literary taste
and educate the sensibilities and moral imagination. Howe
saw that the unpardonable sins of all newspapers are the lack
of humanized matter, and dullness in style; and that, therefore,
no matter how high and worthy the moral aims of
journalism may be, unless a newspaper possesses variety
and readableness, it is doomed to fail both as a newspaper
that otherwise might have endured and as a newspaper that
might have been perennially the voice and the educator of
the spirit. In other words, Joseph Howe saw that the
supreme virtues of first rate journalism, the virtues which
raise journalism to the dignity of literature, are two:
<span class='it'>Humanity</span> and <span class='it'>Urbanity</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five years after the fall of Quebec, that is, in 1764,
when Quebec city had acquired a considerable English-speaking
population, the second of the pioneer Canadian
newspapers was established. This was the <span class='it'>Quebec Gazette</span>.
For seventy-eight years this newspaper was printed in two
languages—English and French. From 1848 till 1880 it
was printed wholly in English. With the coming of the
Loyalists, while New Brunswick was still part of Nova
Scotia, there appeared at St. John, in 1783, the <span class='it'>Royal St.
John Gazette and Nova Scotia Intelligencer</span>. In the following
year, when New Brunswick had become a separate
Province, this newspaper changed its name to the <span class='it'>Royal
Gazette &amp; New Brunswick Advertiser</span>. In 1785 the <span class='it'>Gazette</span>
was established at Montreal. In 1791 and in 1793 newspapers
were established at Charlottetown, Prince Edward
Island, and Niagara, Ontario. In 1806 and in 1810 newspapers
were established at Fredericton, N.B. and Kingston,
Ont. Up to 1810 the newspapers of Canada, with the
notable exception of the <span class='it'>Quebec Gazette</span>, were not at all
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>
in the spirit of constructive journalism, but with the founding
of <span class='it'>The Herald</span> at Montreal in 1811, <span class='it'>The Acadian Recorder</span>
at Halifax in 1813, the <span class='it'>Colonial Advocate</span> at
Queenston in 1824, and <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span> at Halifax in
1824 (purchased by Joseph Howe in 1828), journalism in
Canada took on the scope and complexion of literary and
constructive journalism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Pioneer Newspapers, as contrasted with the Pioneer
and later Canadian Magazines, served very considerably
as ‘the people’s’ reading and as the popular educator. They
were instrumental in creating a desire for intelligence about
Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The
demand was chiefly for commercial and social, and political
news. And so with the desire for news came into existence
an ardent desire for an education in the so-called
‘three R’s.’ As to the style of the reading matter in the
Pioneer Newspapers, it conformed, with notable exceptions,
to the conditions, social and political, of the times.
As a matter of fact, politics were paramount in pioneer
days and up to the triumph of Responsible Government, or
to the middle of the 19th Century. Naturally, therefore,
the newspapers contained considerable satiric writing and
letters on practical matters, including reforms in Government.
Accordingly the general style of the newspapers was
straightforward, often overpointed in vigorous vernacular,
with no care for purity of diction and coherency of sentential
structure. The thing to be said, the matter, must
be said at all hazards—plainly, bluntly, vigorously, and
unmistakably. In all these regards, which were not according
to the English style of journalism under Addison and
Steele, the better newspapers, such as <span class='it'>The Montreal Gazette</span>,
and <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span>, were notable exceptions to the general
run of the Pioneer Newspapers. Howe, for example,
did see to it, with considerable solicitude, that his newspapers,
especially <span class='it'>The Novascotian</span>, should contain genuine
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>
literary matter and that the style of the general reading
matter which appeared in his newspapers should be in
decent readable English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole, therefore, the Pioneer Newspapers of
Canada and those which appeared up to Responsible Government
and Confederation, and later, conformed to the
two ideals of purveyors of intelligence and disseminators
of popular culture. Except in rare instances, however,
they did not foster the creative literary spirit. That function
was left to the Canadian Magazines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As, in the case of daily journalism, Nova Scotia had
priority in establishing newspapers, so, in the case of Canadian
magazines, Nova Scotia also was first in enterprise.
The first magazine to be published in any of the Provinces
of Canada was the <span class='it'>Nova Scotia Magazine</span>, which appeared
at Halifax in 1789, and ceased publication in 1792. The
second Canadian magazine to be published was the <span class='it'>Quebec
Magazine</span>, which appeared at Quebec in 1791 (2). It also
went out of existence in two or three years. The difficulty
then was the same as in the present day. The Canadian
editor and publisher of native magazines could not compete
with the British and the United States magazines, because
the foreign periodicals were more readable and cheaper.
The matter, however, of the earlier Canadian magazines
was, for the most part, genuinely literary and fostered
culture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first magazine in Canada to spread culture and at
the same time to foster amongst native-born or resident
<span class='it'>émigré</span> writers the creative literary spirit, and to publish
contributions in the form of essays, Nature sketches,
and poems by native-born and permanently resident
writers, was the <span class='it'>Literary Garland</span>. It flourished from
1838 to 1851, and numbered amongst its contributors
such men and women of parts as William Dunlop, who
may be regarded as the first <span class='it'>émigré</span> Canadian humorist
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>
in distinction from Haliburton, the first native-born
humorist, Charles Sangster, who was the first native-born
Canadian poet of significant power in original creation,
Susanna Moodie who was a versatile writer of colorful
prose, and the first singer of Canadian Martial Verse, and
her sister Catharine Parr Traill, whose Nature studies and
sketches are still eminently worth reading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year which saw the consummation of the Confederacy
George Stewart, a man of fine critical taste, established
<span class='it'>Stewart’s Quarterly</span> at St. John, N.B. His ideal
was that of the English Quarterlies; and the articles which
appeared in his magazine were notably solid in substance
and distinguished in literary style. <span class='it'>Stewart’s Quarterly</span>
did much to promote culture and to encourage creative
writing on the part of native-born Canadian writers.
Several other magazines which conformed more to the
matter and style of the <span class='it'>Literary Garland</span> were established
in the first 25 years following Confederation. They all
eventually went out of existence. The first magazine to
endure as a cultural agency and genuine fosterer of the literary
spirit was the <span class='it'>Canadian Magazine</span>, founded in 1893 by
J. Gordon Mowat. Under his editorship it grew and further
progressed under the editorship of John A. Cooper.
In 1907 the <span class='it'>Canadian Magazine</span> came under the editorship
of Mr. Newton MacTavish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 1907, when Mr. MacTavish became editor, there
was a distinct and continually progressive change in the
editorial policy of the <span class='it'>Canadian Magazine</span>. Patriotically
he set out to foster the appreciation and production of fine
arts and literature by native-born Canadians. To do this
he reproduced in the magazine paintings and drawings by
Canadian artists, along with special articles, critically appraising
Canadian artists and their art. He also published
essays, criticism, fiction, and poetry, by native-born Canadian
writers. In fact, it was considerably due to the sympathetic
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>
and respectful encouragement which Mr. MacTavish
gave to native-writers, that Canadian poets and
prose writers achieved as splendidly as they have done in
the first quarter of the 20th century, and that constructive
literary criticism and literary history significantly developed
in Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the <span class='it'>Canadian Magazine</span> should be mentioned two
others, the <span class='it'>Queen’s Quarterly</span> and the <span class='it'>University Magazine</span>.
The latter was edited by Sir Andrew Macphail, and
did much to foster letters and criticism in Canada. Amongst
other distinctions, the <span class='it'>University Magazine</span> published not
only the best verse but also the first book of poems by Marjorie
Pickthall, <span class='it'>Drift of Pinions</span> (1913). It ceased publication
in 1921. The <span class='it'>Queen’s Quarterly</span>, always well edited,
is still potent in fostering letters and criticism in Canada.
<span class='it'>The Dalhousie Review</span>, founded in 1921, essayed some of
the ideals of the <span class='it'>University Magazine</span>. But it is given
too much to critical writing by foreign <span class='it'>literati</span> to be potent
in fostering letters and criticism in Canada.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>I. History.</span></h4>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span><span class='sc'>wo</span> general conditions have made the writing of ‘true
history’ in Canada an impossibility. On the personal
side, there were the lack of adequate culture, of a
sense of the historic process and of history as the narrative
of spiritual development, and of any genius, save curiosity,
on the part of those who essayed the writing of history.
Men with the historic imagination did not exist in Canada,
and only ‘minor’ historians were active, up to the beginning
of the 20th century. On the material or instrumental
side, there were the heterogeneity of Canadian civilization,
the want of political unity, the lack of access to documents
and of facilities for historical research, and other untoward
circumstances. Unimaginative minds and the heterogeneity
of life and thought in Canada, before and after Confederation,
limited history for the most part to annals, chronicles,
period and sectional narratives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The number of these uninspired, unimaginative ‘minor’
Canadian historians is legion. The more important were
George Heriot, William Smith, Robert Christie, Alexander
Begg, Beamish Murdock, Duncan Campbell, William
Kingsford, James Hannay, and Egerton Ryerson. Oddly,
the two first native-born historians to write with a show of
imagination and a sense of true history were Thomas
Chandler Haliburton, the humorist, and Major John Richardson,
the romancer.
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Haliburton’s <span class='it'>Historical and Statistical Account of
Nova Scotia</span> was published by Joseph Howe in 1829.
Though the two volumes are, in a degree, a compendium of
facts, Haliburton was not interested in the facts so much
as in the romantic or dramatic story of civilization and
life in Nova Scotia. The way Haliburton imaginatively
handled his material, the way he romantically told the story
and made the whole a colorful and generally absorbing
narrative, constitutes his work as ‘true history.’ It is
Haliburton’s conception of history and his method of
writing it that make him important—though he was not
potent—in this department of Canadian Literature. His
work is an outstanding native example of the romantic
method of writing history as literature; and Haliburton
himself appears as the first Canadian Historian to write
history as if he were writing imaginative literature. But
if he was not potent in his own country, that is, in British
North America, he had, there is good ground to believe,
considerable influence on Francis Parkman. For Parkman
read Haliburton’s <span class='it'>Historical and Statistical Account
of Nova Scotia</span>, and not only had his imagination fired by
such a romantic story as Haliburton tells of the Expulsion
of the Acadians, but also adopted the romantic method of
Haliburton in writing his own historical works.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best account of the War of 1812 came from the
pen of Major John Richardson, who had served in the
conflict. It is the account of an eye-witness. It was written
hurriedly for publication serially in his newspaper the
<span class='it'>New Era</span>, and was reprinted in book form in 1842. As
might be expected, Richardson presents vividly the drama
or dramatic movement of his story, and makes it a colorful,
gripping narrative. But though, like Haliburton,
Richardson wrote graphically, romantically, he is superior
to Haliburton in an important respect. The Nova Scotia
historian and humorist did not have any gift for sharp
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>
character-drawing; his characters, like Dickens’ or
Twain’s, stand out and hold us by what they say. But
Richardson’s characters in his account of the War of 1812,
especially Brock and Tecumseh, are vividly drawn by their
<span class='it'>action</span>, and stand out sharply individualized. In Haliburton’s
<span class='it'>Historical Account of Nova Scotia</span> we get only colorful
romance. In Richardson’s <span class='it'>War of 1812</span> we get colorful
romance, dramatic movement, and memorable character
portraiture. It, too, is ‘true history,’ and his work, like
Haliburton’s, is an outstanding native example of the romantic
method of writing history as literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Haliburton and Richardson, all history of Canada,
or the Provinces, by native-born or <span class='it'>émigré</span> writers was
fragmentary in conception and dry-as-dust in matter and
method. They all show inquisitiveness, diligence, though
not careful research, and no imagination, and certainly no
sense of history as the outward expression and movement
of a people’s social and spiritual evolution. Yet the work
of one man must be specially remarked. He was Alpheus
Todd, who, in the department of Constitutional History,
wrote a work which was long regarded as the greatest study
of the English constitution written by any British subject.
This really ‘monumental’ historical work was entitled
<span class='it'>Parliamentary Government in England; its Origin, Development,
and Practical Operation</span>. The first volume was
published in 1867, the year of Canadian Confederation.
But while Todd’s work is a ‘monument’ to his scholarship
and industry, and while it has historic perspective, it is,
like the work of preceding historians, without imagination
and was written by one who had no conception of constitutional
history as the expression of the social conscience
gradually realizing, under changing conditions, the ideal of
the rights of the spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the beginning of the 20th century, Canadian historians
based their work on documentary research and
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span>
wrote history with a lively sense of imaginative or romantic
values which corresponded to the method and manner
of Haliburton and Richardson. This change in the method
of writing ‘true history’ is notably exemplified in <span class='it'>Quebec
Under Two Flags</span> and in <span class='it'>The Cradle of New France</span> by A.
G. Doughty; in <span class='it'>The Fight for Canada</span>, by William Wood;
and, later, in <span class='it'>The Conquest of the Great North-West</span>,
<span class='it'>Pathfinders of the West</span>, and <span class='it'>Vikings of the Pacific</span>, by
Agnes Laut. Doughty was a poet before he became an
historian, and in writing history let his imagination play
over the facts, thus transmuting the documentary material
into literature. William Wood also applied the romanticist’s
imagination to the facts, and, besides, wrote history with
a fine feeling for style and characterization somewhat in
the manner of Parkman. Miss Laut, basing her matter
on thorough research, humanized it with a sympathetic appreciation
of the struggles of the pioneers of the Canadian
West and with a picturesque literary style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sectional and local histories of Canada abound. There
are also race histories and several so-called School Histories.
But these are all of popular quality and have no
distinction in literary style, although the narratives of W.
J. Rattray, George Stewart, H. Scadding, J. Ross Robertson,
John Murray Gibbon, Sir John Bourinot and Charles
G. D. Roberts show a considerable solicitude for style and
actually achieve good literary style.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>II. Biography.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>As with general history, so with personal or spiritual
history. Biographical writing in Canada is sparse in quantity
and, on the whole, insignificant in literary quality.
Often the subject of a biographical narrative was great
enough to compel imaginative and artistic creation on the
part of the writer. Seldom, however, does any biographer
of a Canadian man of distinction rise to his subject either in
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>
conception or in style. But of those who did rise to their
subject, one was Charles Lindsey, who wrote <span class='it'>The Life and
Times of William Lyon MacKenzie</span>. Lindsey handled his
material so as to present the proper values in the political
and social problems in the time of the famous leader of the
Rebellion of 1837. Another of those who rose to his
subject and who wrote with a sense of the really significant
events in the life of his subject, presenting the salients with
decent respect for truth, with adequate detail, and yet with
readable style, was Sir Joseph Pope, who gave the literary
world a compelling and vigorously moving biographical
volume, <span class='it'>Memoirs of the Right Honourable Sir John Alexander
Macdonald</span>. It is a vigorous narrative, but rather
inflexible in style. Sir John Stephen Willison’s <span class='it'>Sir Wilfrid
Laurier and The Liberal Party</span> is an outstanding
biography. Like Lindsey, Sir John Willison was a thoroughly
trained journalist before he attempted biographical
writing. Along with the journalist’s vigor and vivacity of
style, Sir John Willison wrote with feeling for dignified
and elegant diction. His <span class='it'>Wilfrid Laurier</span> is notable chiefly
for its refinement in prose style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George Monro Grant’s <span class='it'>Joseph Howe</span> is a <span class='it'>tour de force</span>
in brilliant word painting and hero worship. It misses the
significance of Howe as an original and constructive mind.
Longley’s <span class='it'>Joseph Howe</span> is a popular narrative, careless of
logic and literary style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several other individual biographies of Canadians by
Canadians have been published. The best of them are
Duncan Campbell Scott’s <span class='it'>John Graves Simcoe</span>, Adam
Shortt’s <span class='it'>Lord Sydenham</span>, George M. Wrong’s <span class='it'>Life of Lord
Elgin</span>, Arnold Haultain’s <span class='it'>Goldwin Smith: His Life and
Opinions</span>, Grant and Hamilton’s <span class='it'>George Monro Grant</span>,
and Edith J. Archibald’s <span class='it'>Life and Letters of Sir Edward
Mortimer Archibald</span>. But a genuinely great biography of
a great man remains to be written in Canada.
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Deserving of mention are three short popular biographies—Owen
McGillicuddy’s sketch of the life and
achievements of Rt. Hon. MacKenzie King, Premier of
Canada, which appears under the title <span class='it'>The Making of a
Premier</span> (1922); John W. Dafoe’s <span class='it'>Laurier</span> (1922) and
Peter McArthur’s <span class='it'>Laurier</span> (1922). These biographies are
by practical journalists, and are journalistic in style.
Dafoe’s Laurier is the most acute and weighty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A genuine literary achievement in biographical writing
is M. O. Hammond’s <span class='it'>Confederation and Its Leaders</span>
(1917). It is based on thorough research, and, as a series
of intimate political biographies in the form of narrative
sketches, is packed with human interest, and is marked by
a straightforward, commonsense style. It has a high
seriousness, and in this respect contrasts with the lighter,
more piquant but less persuasive style of Augustus Bridle’s
<span class='it'>Sons of Canada</span>—a work which is essentially a series of
familiar portraits, done as <span class='it'>jeux d’esprit</span>.</p>

<h4><span class='it'>III. Travels, Exploration, Sport.</span></h4>

<p class='pindent'>Canada has a considerable quantity of the literature of
travels, explorations and sport but the literary interest of
the most of it is far from obvious. A really remarkable
book in this genre is the elder Alexander Henry’s <span class='it'>Travels
and Adventures in Canada and The Indian Territories</span>,
published in New York in 1809. Henry was a man of
acute observation, and also possessed a graphic pen for
character limning. His <span class='it'>Travels and Adventures</span> engages
both the intellect and the imagination, the scientist and the
literary artist. For it contains the most interesting observations
on the flora and fauna of the countries he visited,
and really graphic and colorful pictures of the peoples and
the characters he met and observed. Henry had also a
gift like that of Thucydides—the gift and skill of dramatically
reporting a speech as, for instance, the speech of the
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>
Ojibwa Chief Minavavana. The book really forms an entrancing
and instructive volume of Travel and Adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same may be said of Sir Alexander Mackenzie’s
<span class='it'>Voyages From Montreal Through the Continent of North
America, 1789-1793</span>. This work was published at London
in 1801. Mackenzie came from a people—the Gaels of the
Island of Lewis—who have a racial gift of colorful
imagination and of felicity of language in nature description.
Mackenzie, moreover, was, like Henry, a keen observer.
His <span class='it'>Voyages</span>, therefore, as might be expected, are
marked by colorful style and the imaginative presentation
of the scenes he visited and of the inspiring or sublime
phenomena he observed. John Howison’s <span class='it'>Sketches of
Upper Canada</span> conforms only to the ideal of fact. It is, as
the title suggests, merely a series of ‘sketches,’ written in a
vigorous style with only a touch here and there of finer
literary style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the work of Anna Brownell Jameson we meet
with the first ‘color-writing’ in and about Canada. Her
<span class='it'>Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada</span>, published
in London in 1838, has not yet been excelled by a native
Canadian ‘color writer.’ At the time, Canada was a
wilderness for the most part, with a few settlements, but
Mrs. Jameson, with the eye of an artist, saw everywhere
in Nature in Canada and in Canadian life and character
much to delight the eye and the sensibilities and much to
satisfy the pictorial and dramatic imagination. Her <span class='it'>Winter
Studies and Summer Rambles</span>, in three volumes, are a
library of winsome Nature sketches and critical appreciations
of human personality—a work of art, and a permanent
contribution to the Incidental Pioneer Literature of
Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aesthetic sense and the artistic conscience were
uppermost in Paul Kane’s <span class='it'>Wanderings of An Artist
Among The Indian Tribes of North America</span>. Kane was
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span>
a celebrated Canadian painter; and, having the gift of
style, he wrote, with the eye of the pictorial artist, about
his ‘wanderings’ among the western tribes. It is an informing
volume and makes genuinely interesting and
satisfying reading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George M. Grant was a man of splendid force of character
and strength of will tempered with a singular gift of
humor and pathos. He travelled across Canada in the last
five years of the first decade following Confederation, he
met all peoples, dwelt in camps, visited trading posts, and
stopped at the hotels of the larger centres. On his journey
he was impressed by the <span class='it'>life</span>, <span class='it'>energy</span>, and the <span class='it'>striving</span> of
the Canadian people for a self-reliant and worthy history
and destiny. And so Grant’s volume of travel, <span class='it'>Ocean to
Ocean</span>, is noted for its acute observation, for its colorful
and vitalizing descriptions of Nature in Canada, and for
its seriousness, at all times relieved by an unusual quality
of humor and of pathos. In ‘color-writing’ too, the volume
is, at times, incomparable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>J. W. Tyrrell’s <span class='it'>Across the Sub-Arctics of Canada</span> and
his <span class='it'>The St. Lawrence Basin and Its Border-Lands</span>, Lawrence
J. Burpee’s <span class='it'>The Search for The Western Sea</span>,
Vilhjalmur Stefannson’s <span class='it'>The Friendly Arctic</span> and his
<span class='it'>Hunters of the Great North</span>, Arthur Heming’s <span class='it'>Drama of
the Forests</span>, are all noted for their literary style and for the
dramatic pictures they make of Nature scenes and of
human characters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two really notable books under the head of Sport, as
a form of travel and adventure, are Arthur Silver’s <span class='it'>Farm,
Cottage, Camp and Canoe In Maritime Canada</span> (1884) and
Phil. H. Moore’s <span class='it'>With Gun and Rod in Canada</span> (1922).
Silver’s volume makes pleasant reading, but the style is
much more pedestrian than Moore’s work, which is heightened
and colored by picturesque diction and images and
by considerable characteristic humor. Midway between
<span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span>
the greater books of Travel and Adventure and these books
of Sport come Wilfred Grenfell’s volumes descriptive of
Labrador and the late C. Gordon Hewitt’s <span class='it'>Conservation of
the Wild Life of Canada</span>. The latter, though scientific
in aim and method, is full of aesthetic and literary charm
and is written in an interesting literary style.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
